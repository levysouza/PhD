orthography system writing conventions used represent spoken english written form allows readers connect spelling sound meaning like orthography world languages english orthography broad degree standardisation however unlike languages multiple ways spell nearly every phoneme sound letters also multiple pronunciations depending position word context several orthographic mistakes common even among native speakers this mainly due large number words borrowed large number languages throughout history english language without successful attempts complete spelling reforms most spelling conventions modern english derived phonetic spelling variety middle english generally reflect sound changes occurred since late century great vowel shift despite various english dialects spoken country country within different regions country slight regional variations english orthography two recognised variations british american spelling overall uniformity helps facilitate international communication hand also adds discrepancy way english written spoken given location function letters edit note following discussion one two common pronunciations american british english varieties used article word cited other regional pronunciations may possible words indicating possible regional variants article impractical phonemic representation edit letters english orthography usually represent particular sound phoneme for example word cat consists three letters represents sound sound sound sequences letters may perform role well single letters thus word ship pronounced digraph two letters represents sound word ditch trigraph tch represents sound less commonly single letter represent multiple successive sounds the common example letter normally represents consonant cluster example word six pronounced the letter sequence letters may pronounced different ways occurs different positions within word for instance digraph represents sound end words rough though others though beginning syllables syllable onset digraph pronounced word ghost pronounced conversely digraph never pronounced syllable onsets inflected forms almost never pronounced syllable codas proper name pittsburgh exception some words contain silent letters represent sound modern english pronunciation examples include doubt debt dumb etc psychology pneumatic mentioned numerous words though daughter night brought commonly encountered silent discussed word origin edit another type spelling characteristic related word origin for example representing vowel letter represents sound words borrowed greek reflecting original upsilon whereas letter usually representing sound non greek words letter thus word myth greek origin pith germanic word other examples include pronounced usually spelled pronounced usually spelled use spellings sounds often mark words borrowed greek some researchers brengelman suggested addition marking word origin spellings indicate formal level style register given text although rollings finds point exaggerated would many exceptions word one spellings like telephone could occur informal text homophone differentiation edit spelling may also useful distinguish homophones words pronunciation different meanings although cases reason difference historical introduced purpose making distinction for example words heir air pronounced identically dialects writing distinguished different spellings another example pair homophones pain pane pronounced two different spellings vowel often historical pronunciation word time two separate sounds become different spellings remain pain used pronounced pain diphthong pane diphthong merged long vowel pane making pain pane homophones pane pain merger later became diphthong written language may help resolve potential ambiguities would arise otherwise breaking car braking car nevertheless many homophones remain unresolved spelling example word bay least five fundamentally different meanings marking sound changes letters edit some letters english provide information pronunciation letters word rollings uses term markers letters letters may mark different types information for instance letter word cottage indicates preceding pronounced rather common value word final position sound tag the letter also often marks altered pronunciation preceding vowel pair ban bane ban value whereas bane marked value context pronounced referred silent single letter may even fill multiple pronunciation marking roles simultaneously for example word wage marks change also word vague marks long sound keeps hard rather soft doubled consonants usually indicate preceding vowel pronounced short for example doubled latter indicates pronounced single later gives doubled consonants indicate lengthening gemination consonant sound come different morphemes unnatural natural multiple functionality edit given letter letters may dual functions for example letter word cinema sound representing function representing sound pronunciation marking function marking value opposed value underlying representation edit like many alphabetic orthographies english spelling represent non contrastive phonetic sounds minor differences pronunciation used distinguish different words although letter pronounced speakers aspiration beginning words never indicated spelling indeed phonetic detail probably noticeable average native speaker trained phonetics however unlike orthographies english orthography often represents abstract underlying representation morphophonemic form english words postulated underlying forms systematically related conventional orthography well known related underlying forms much earlier historical stage language there words little change lexical representation since middle english consequently would expect lexical representation would differ little dialect dialect modern english conventional orthography probably fairly close optimal modern english dialects well attested dialects past several hundred years cases given morpheme component word fixed spelling even though pronounced differently different words example past tense suffix may pronounced variously example dip dipped boom boomed loot looted happens different pronunciations predicted phonological rules reason spelling fixed another example involves vowel differences accompanying stress pattern changes several related words for instance word photographer derived word photograph adding derivational suffix when suffix added vowel pronunciations change largely owing moveable stress spelling pronunciation photograph photographer photographical other examples type ity suffix agile agility acid acidity divine divinity sane sanity see also trisyllabic laxing another class words includes sign bomb silent letters respectively however related words signature bombard letters pronounced respectively here could argued underlying representation sign bomb underlying pronounced surface forms followed certain suffixes ature ard otherwise realised surface pronunciation standing alone followed suffixes like ing cases orthography indicates underlying consonants present certain words absent related words other examples include fast fasten heir inherit another example includes words like mean meant here vowel spelling pronounced differently two related words thus orthography uses single spelling corresponds single morphemic form rather surface phonological form english orthography always provide underlying representation sometimes provides intermediate representation underlying form surface pronunciation this case spelling regular plural morpheme written either tick ticks mite mites box boxes here spelling pronounced either depending environment ticks pigs usually pronounced boxes thus two different spellings correspond single underlying representation plural suffix three surface forms the spelling indicates insertion spelling indicate devoiced distinctly unaffected spelling the abstract representation words indicated orthography considered advantageous since makes etymological relationships apparent english readers this makes writing english complex arguably makes reading english efficient however abstract underlying representations chomsky halle underspecification theories sometimes considered abstract accurately reflect communicative competence native speakers followers arguments believe less abstract surface forms psychologically real thus useful terms pedagogy diacritics edit english words written accent marks these words mostly imported languages usually french imported words become increasingly naturalised increasing tendency omit accent marks even formal writing for example words tel first seen accents borrowed english accent almost never used the words originally considered foreign people considered english alternatives preferable today foreign origin largely forgotten words likely retain accent atypical english
