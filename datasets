(Law.com",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_chart_achievements_and_milestones,Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones,"This is a comprehensive listing that highlights significant achievements and milestones based upon Billboard magazine's singles charts, most notably the Billboard Hot 100. This list spans the period from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The Billboard Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular music chart in the United States. Prior to the creation of the Hot 100, Billboard published four singles charts: ""Best Sellers in Stores"", ""Most Played by Jockeys"", ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" and ""The Top 100"". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations. All items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts). All-Time Hot 100 achievements (1958–2018) In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists. In 2013, Billboard revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition. In 2015, Billboard revised the rankings again. In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the Billboard chart's 60th anniversary. Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018. Also shown are the artists placing the most songs on the overall ""all-time"" top 100 song list.

From 1955 to 2001, under Billboard's previous methodologies, only two singles ascended directly to #1 from a previous position beneath the Top 20: The Beatles' ""Can't Buy Me Love"", which jumped from #27 to the top slot in April 1964, and Brandy and Monica's ""The Boy Is Mine"" which jumped from #23 to #1 in June 1998.

When the songs originally charted in 1984, their chart positions in their final week on the Hot 100 were well below the top 10. Prior to 2008, the biggest drop off the Hot 100 was ""Nights in White Satin"" by The Moody Blues, which ranked at #17 in its final week on the chart in December 1972. This high drop-off position was matched in January 1975 by ""Junior's Farm"" by Paul McCartney and Wings. The record descent held for over three decades.  Each song above dropped off the Hot 100 upon four or fewer weeks; ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Junior's Farm"" dropped off after 18 and 12 weeks, respectively. Source: Seasonal songs During the holiday season, which includes Christmas, these songs regularly appear on the Hot 100, generally departing from the chart after the holiday season ends. In recent years, seasonal songs have reached into the top ten, and in 2019, for only the second time ever on the Hot 100 (the first since 1958), made it to number one. This has led to all-time records for dropping off the Hot 100, including from number one, as the songs depart the chart regardless of their final chart positions during the season.

Billboard now credits the dual #1 Presley single ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" as a single chart entity, and credits Presley with 17 number one singles. ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" spent 11 weeks at #1, ""Hound Dog"" for 6 weeks, ""Don't Be Cruel"" for 5 weeks. Many chart statisticians however, such as Joel Whitburn, still list Presley as having 18 number ones.  Source: Most cumulative weeks at number one † Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Presley is sometimes credited with an ""80th week"" that occurred when ""All Shook Up"" spent a ninth week on top of the ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" chart. Although Billboard's chart statistician Joel Whitburn still counts this 80th week based on preexisting research, Billboard magazine itself has since revised its methodology and officially credits Presley with 79 weeks. Much of Presley's total factors in pre-Hot 100 data. If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Fergie, if Black Eyed Peas is included, this would put Fergie on the list with 34 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Michael Jackson, if The Jackson 5, which would also be later known as The Jacksons is included, this would give Michael Jackson 47 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For singer Beyoncé, if Destiny's Child is included, this would give Beyoncé 59 cumulative weeks at #1. All six weeks from the Perfect duet with Ed Sheeran are also included. Note: For singer Diana Ross, if The Supremes are included, this would give Diana Ross 42 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For each of the Beatles: If John Lennon's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give John Lennon 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Paul McCartney's total weeks were to include the Beatles, as well as Wings, this would give Paul McCartney 89 cumulative weeks at #1. If George Harrison's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give George Harrison 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Ringo Starr's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give Ringo Starr 61 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For rapper Drake if the track ""Sicko Mode"" is included, this would put Drake on the list with 50 weeks at #1. Most consecutive number-one singles Houston's ""Thinking About You"" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio. Likewise, Perry's ""Not Like the Movies"" and ""Circle the Drain"" were only promotional singles, not radio singles. With the streak spanning from her debut single ""Vision of Love"" until ""Emotions,"" Mariah Carey became the first artist in Hot 100 history to have their first 5 solo singles reach #1 on the chart.

Michael Jackson (age 11 years, 155 days) is the youngest artist to top the Hot 100. He achieved the record, as part of the Jackson 5, with ""I Want You Back"" on January 31, 1970.

The song which established this record for her was ""I Will Follow Him"", which reached #1 on April 27, 1963. Fred Stobaugh (age 96 years, 23 days) is the oldest living artist to chart on the Hot 100. He was featured on the Green Shoe Studio song ""Oh Sweet Lorriane"", which ranked at #42 on September 14, 2013. The previous record was held by Tony Bennett, who was 85 years, 59 days old when his song ""Body and Soul"", a duet with Amy Winehouse, ranked at #87 on October 1, 2011. French-born Jordy Lemoine (age 5 years, 156 days) is the youngest artist to chart on the Hot 100. He established the record when his song ""Dur dur d'être bébé! (It's Tough to Be a Baby)"", where he is credited simply as Jordy, entered the chart on June 19, 1993. Gap records The longest gap between #1 hits on the Hot 100 for an artist is 24 years, 355 days by Cher. Her single ""Believe"" hit #1 on March 13, 1999, her first time on top since ""Dark Lady"" on March 23, 1974. The record for the longest wait from an artist's Hot 100 debut entry to its first #1 belongs to Santana, with 30 years between the time he first cracked the Hot 100 with ""Jingo"" (October 25, 1969) and the first of 12 weeks at #1 with ""Smooth,"" featuring Rob Thomas (October 23, 1999). When ""4th Dimension"" by Kids See Ghosts featuring Louis Prima debuted at #42 for the week of June 23, 2018, Prima became the artist with the longest overall span of singles on the Hot 100 – 57 years, 130 days on account of his single ""Wonderland by Night"" which last appeared at #89 on the Hot 100, dated February 13, 1961. Bobby Helms' ""Jingle Bell Rock"" holds the record for the longest trip to the Hot 100's top 10: 60 years and two weeks. It first appeared on the Hot 100 dated December 22, 1958 and reached the top 10 on the chart dated January 5, 2019 peaking at #8. Additionally, as his song ""Dreams"" debuted on the third Hot 100 ever, (dated August 18, 1958) Helms subsequently ends the longest wait for an artist's first top 10: 60 years, four months and two weeks. Burl Ives holds the record for the longest break between Hot 100 top 10's: He returned to the top 10 after 56 years, seven months and two weeks, when ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" reached #10 on the chart dated January 5, 2019. Mariah Carey holds the record gap between first and most recent No. 1 on the Hot 100 over the longest period of time: 29 years, four months and two weeks, dating to her first week at No. 1 on the chart dated August 4, 1990, with ""Vision of Love"" to her most recent No. 1, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", which reached number one on the chart dated December 21, 2019. Cher previously held this record over a period of 27 years and 5 months, ranging from the first of two weeks at No. 1 for ""Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves"" on November 6, 1971 to the last week at No. 1 for ""Believe"" on April 3, 1999. This record only counts Cher's solo career: if her time as part of Sonny & Cher is included, her span would cover 33 years, seven months and two weeks, starting with the first of three weeks at No. 1 for ""I Got You Babe"" with Sonny on August 14, 1965. Album achievements Most number-one singles from one album Source: Saturday Night Fever generated number-one singles for two different artists: ""How Deep Is Your Love"", ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Night Fever"" by the Bee Gees; and ""If I Can't Have You"" by Yvonne Elliman. Katy Perry's Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was a reissue of the Teenage Dream album, and featured an additional single, ""Part Of Me"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This brings her actual total to six. However, this does not count since the single comes from a reissue of the album and not the original release. Most top ten singles from one album Source: † Waiting to Exhale generated top ten singles for five different artists: ""Exhale (Shoop Shoop)"" and ""Count on Me"" by Whitney Houston (the latter with CeCe Winans), ""Not Gon' Cry"" by Mary J. Blige, ""Sittin' Up in My Room"" by Brandy, and ""Let It Flow"" by Toni Braxton. Other album achievements Janet Jackson's Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 has the most top 5 singles, with 7.

Record includes these five 1965 A-sides and ""We Can Work It Out"", which hit #1 in January 1966. Source: Selected additional Hot 100 achievements The first #1 song on the Hot 100 was ""Poor Little Fool"" by Ricky Nelson (August 4, 1958). The shortest #1 song of all time is ""Stay"" by Maurice Williams And The Zodiacs. It runs for a length of 1 minute, 38 seconds. It topped the Hot 100 for one week on November 21, 1960. The #1 song in the first week Billboard incorporated sales and airplay data from Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems was ""Set Adrift on Memory Bliss"" by P.M. Dawn (November 30, 1991). The #1 song in the first week Billboard allowed songs without a commercial single release to chart on the Hot 100 was ""I'm Your Angel"" by R. Kelly and Céline Dion (December 5, 1998). Though the song was making its first appearance on the Hot 100 that week, Billboard did not consider it a debut at #1, since it appeared on unpublished test charts prior to the allowance of airplay-only songs on the main chart. ""I'm Your Angel"" also entered the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart that week at #1, so it would have been ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 before then. The first ""airplay-only"" song to reach #1 (no points from a commercial single release) was ""Try Again"" by Aaliyah (June 17, 2000). Drake holds the record for the most entries in the Hot 100 during a one-week period, with 27 on the July 14, 2018 chart. The Beatles had long held this record, occupying 14 positions on the Hot 100 dated April 11, 1964, a feat unmatched for nearly 51 years. On March 7, 2015, Drake tied the Beatles mark, and he equaled it again on October 17 that year. Justin Bieber then reset the record to 17 on December 5, 2015, before Drake reclaimed the record with 20 on May 21, 2016, and broke his own record with 27 on July 14, 2018. Drake also holds the record for the most debuting entries on a Hot 100 chart by any artist, with 22 on July 14, 2018. Taylor Swift is the record-holder among female artists for the most simultaneous entries in the Hot 100, with 18 on the September 7, 2019 chart. Previous record holders were Billie Eilish (14), Cardi B (13), Ariana Grande (12), and Beyoncé (12). Ariana Grande is the record-holder among female artists with the most songs charting in the top 40 simultaneously, with 11 on the February 23, 2019 chart. The Beatles are the only artists to simultaneously hold the top 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 albums chart. They achieved this feat for nine consecutive weeks, from February 29, 1964, to April 25, 1964. For the first five weeks of that run, through March 28, 1964, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You"" were the #1 and #2 singles (which swapped positions during March 1964), while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles held the top 2 spots on the albums charts. For the remaining weeks of the run, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and their cover of ""Twist and Shout"" were the #1 and #2 singles, while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles continued their reign as the top 2 albums. Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney hold the record of writing all of the Top 3 singles for one week. The Gibbs co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 18, 1978 – #1 ""Night Fever"" and #2 ""Stayin' Alive"" for the Bee Gees, and #3 ""Emotion"" for Samantha Sang. Lennon and McCartney co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 14, 1964 – #1 ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", #2 ""She Loves You"", and #3 ""Please Please Me"", all for The Beatles. They continued this record the following week of March 21, 1964, when ""She Loves You"" switched places with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". The Black Eyed Peas hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time at #1 on the Hot 100, a total of 26 consecutive weeks from April to October 2009. ""Boom Boom Pow"" spent the first 12 weeks on top, with ""I Gotta Feeling"" taking over for the remaining 14 weeks. Prior to August 2009, Usher held this record, spending 19 consecutive weeks on top of the chart in 2004 with ""Yeah!"" (12 weeks at #1) and ""Burn"" (first 7 of its 8 total weeks at #1). On December 4, 2010, Rihanna's ""Only Girl (In the World)"" reached the top spot two weeks after ""What's My Name?"", becoming the first time in Hot 100 history that an album's debut single hit #1 after the second single did. Ed Sheeran became the first artist to debut more than one song in the top 10 for the same week. On the chart dated January 28, 2017, ""Shape of You"" debuted at #1, while ""Castle on the Hill"" entered at #6. Drake later achieved this feat on three separate occasions, doing so on April 8, 2017, February 3, 2018, and July 14, 2018. In the latter week, Drake broke the record by debuting four songs in the top 10. Drake is the only artist to have a number-one debut replace another number-one debut. He did this April 21, 2018, when ""Nice For What"" replaced ""God's Plan"" at the summit, after the latter had spent eleven weeks on top. Drake holds the record for being on the Hot 100 for the most consecutive weeks. He placed at least one song, either in a lead or featured role, on every chart from his debut on May 23, 2009, to August 19, 2017, for a total of 431 weeks in a row. Ariana Grande is the only artist to have the lead single from each of her first five albums debut in the Hot 100's top 10. On July 14, 2018, Drake set the record for the most songs in the top ten at once, with seven. The Beatles had previously held the record, since 1964, with five entries. Ariana Grande is the first artist whose first two number-one songs both debuted at the top. She achieved this with the songs ""Thank U, Next"" and ""7 Rings"", on the charts dated November 17, 2018 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Mariah Carey is the first artist to have a number-one single in four different decades after ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" topped the chart in January 2020 for a third consecutive week.

https://business.inquirer.net/251677/gdp-growth-projection-asia-2018,"GDP Growth Projection for Asia, 2018","Boasting one of the world's youngest workforce, India is projected to be the fastest growing economy in Asia in 2018. The country's growth rate this year is estimated to beat other Asian economies, including that of rival China. Bhutan, one of the world's smallest countries with limited access to global markets, is projected to have the second fastest economy in Asia. The country is expected have a growth rate of 6.9 percent in 2018, compared to 6.7 percent in 2017 and eight per cent in 2016. Cambodia, Philippines and Myanmar are the other top performing countries in Asia, as per their rate of economic growth. Cambodia's growth rate for 2018 is expected to be 6.9 percent, which is more or less consistent with its growth rate of 2017 (6.8 percent) and 2016 (7 percent). The Philippines, whose medium-term growth outlook has been termed “positive” by the World Bank, is going to have the same growth rate as last year (6.7 percent). The country's economic growth was marginally higher at 6.9 percent in 2016. Described as one of Asia's emerging economies, Myanmar is also one of the better performing countries in Asia in terms of its GDP growth. The country, which is classified as “lower-middle income economy” with a GNI per capita of $1,455 in 2017 by the World Bank, is expected to clock a 6.7 percent GDP growth in 2018. The country registered an economic growth of 6.4 percent in 2017 and 5.9 percent in 2016.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States,Recessions in the United States,"There have been as many as 47 recessions in the United States dating back to the Articles of Confederation, and although economists and historians dispute certain 19th-century recessions, the consensus view among economists and historians is that ""The cyclical volatility of GNP and unemployment was greater before the Great Depression than it has been since the end of World War II."" Cycles in the country's agricultural production, industrial production, consumption, business investment, and the health of the banking industry contribute to these declines. U.S. recessions have increasingly affected economies on a worldwide scale, especially as countries' economies become more intertwined. The unofficial beginning and ending dates of recessions in the United States have been defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), an American private nonprofit research organization. The NBER defines a recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than two quarters which is 6 months, normally visible in real gross domestic product (GDP), real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales"". In the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with financial crises. Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises. Major modern economic statistics, such as unemployment and GDP, were not compiled on a regular and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, it is difficult to compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors. Early recessions and crises Attempts have been made to date recessions in America beginning in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed time series of the data. The earliest recessions for which there is the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises. Beginning in 1835, an index of business activity by the Cleveland Trust Company provides data for comparison between recessions. Beginning in 1854, the National Bureau of Economic Research dates recession peaks and troughs to the month.  However, a standardized index does not exist for the earliest recessions. In 1791, Congress chartered the First Bank of the United States to handle the country's financial needs. The bank had some functions of a modern central bank, although it was responsible for only 20% of the young country's currency. In 1811 the bank's charter lapsed, but it was replaced by the Second Bank of the United States, which lasted from 1816–36. Free Banking Era to the Great Depression In the 1830s, U.S. President Andrew Jackson fought to end the Second Bank of the United States. Following the Bank War, the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was no national presence in banking, but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the National Banking Act, creating nationally chartered banks. There was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, and thus banking panics were common. Recessions often led to bank panics and financial crises, which in turn worsened the recession. The dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as gross domestic product and unemployment, were not gathered during this period. Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, which can be used to compare recessions. Great Depression onward Following the end of World War II and the large adjustment as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). The unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression. In the Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of the second quarter of 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession). The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on a monthly basis back to 1854; according to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Many factors that may have contributed to this moderation including the establishment of deposit insurance in the form of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 and increased regulation of the banking sector. Other changes include the use of fiscal policy in the form of automatic stabilizers to alleviate cyclical volatility. The creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 has been disputed as a source of stability with it and its policies having mixed successes. Since the early 1980s the sources of the Great Moderation has been attributed to numerous causes including public policy, industry practices, technology, and even good luck.","US recessions, Free Banking Era to the Great Depression",0.763432,"[['Name','Dates','Duration','Time since previous recession','Business activity','Trade & industrial activity','Characteristics']['1836–1838 recession','—','~2 years','~2 years','–32.8%','—','A sharp downturn in the American economy was caused by bank failures, lack of confidence in the paper currency, tightening of English Credit, crop failures and Jacksonian policy.

The recession may be explained partly by ongoing financial difficulties following the war, which discouraged businesses from building up inventories. Several months into the recession, there was a major financial panic']['Panic of 1873 and the Long Depression','Oct 1873 –; Mar 1879','5 years; 5 months','2 years; 10 months','−33.6% (−27.3%)','—','Economic problems in Europe prompted the failure of Jay Cooke & Company, the largest bank in the United States, which burst the post-Civil War speculative bubble. The Coinage Act of 1873 also contributed by immediately depressing the price of silver, which hurt North American mining interests. The deflation and wage cuts of the era led to labor turmoil, such as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. In 1879, the United States returned to the gold standard with the Specie Payment Resumption Act. This is the longest period of economic contraction recognized by the NBER.

This Panic was also precipitated in part by a run on the gold supply. The Treasury had to issue bonds to purchase enough gold.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/minorityview/states-with-high-levels-of-migration-also-have-higher-per-capita-incomes,States with high levels of migration also have higher per capita incomes,"The recently released numbers on migration levels in different states from the decennial census brings out some interesting insights on the linkages between migration and levels of development as measured by per capita income. One stark factor that stands is the huge disparities in the migration level across the states which in census parlance is defined as movement from one village or town to another village or town across or within states. While migration levels in the small western state of Goa was 77.4% it was a low 22.6% in Jammu and Kashmir. At the all India level the share of the migrant population is more than one third with 37% of the people having moved from one place to another. However, this number only serves to camouflage the sizable differences in the level of migration across the states. Among the 21 large states for which we have compiled data we find that at the top of the chain are states like Maharashtra and Goa, both western states, where the share migrant population is more than half. While it is a high 77.4% in Goa it was an equally impressive 51% in Maharashtra. Then there is the next category of states where the level of migration varies from 40% to 50%. There are at least 89 states in this category and include Punjab, Kerala, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Most of these states are in the north and southern parts of the country. In the next rung are 8 states where the share of migrant labour hovers from 30% to 40%. They are Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. The three important states at the bottom of the list includes Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir with the levels of migration only 29.6%, 28% and 22.6% respectively. Looking at the rankings one finds that there is no regional trend. States with the highest level of migrant population include those in the north, west and south of the country. However, states with the least amount of migrant population is mainly in the north and the East. But what is more striking is the close linkages between levels of migrant population and per capita incomes. Thus we find that the top ten important states with the highest level of migration are also the states with the highest per capita incomes. Vice versa states with lower levels of migrant population are in the second half of the ranking of states in terms of per capita income. This is also buttressed by the per capita income of people in states with different levels of migration. Thus we find that while the average per capita income of people in five states with the highest level of migration was Rs 1,07, 507 in 2010-11 that of the states in the next five grouping was only Rs 78,385. Similarly per capita incomes of people in five states in the third and fourth rungs of migration levels was only Rs 49,786 crore and Rs 34,321 crore while the two states in the last rung had a per capita income of only Rs 29,600. All this clearly indicates that high levels of migration is certainly linked with high per capita incomes and vice versa. To find out the cause and effect, that is does high per capita income cause greater mobility or is it greater mobility that help improve per capita income levels, one would have to do a more detailed analysis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density,United States cities by population density,"The following is a list of incorporated places in the United States with a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is defined as a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been ""incorporated"" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated and so an ""incorporated place"" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township. The other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below. Incorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile The following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2010 U.S. Census, except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state, and ranked by total population; the population density for each place is also given in the lists. The population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles; the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below. The list below only includes incorporated places of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below. The District of Columbia would be included in the list, but Washington, D.C. misses the 10,000 mark as it has a population density of 9,800 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census (as of 2013 American Community Survey estimates, however, Washington now has a density of 10,528 people per square mile). Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Census-designated places The following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if it was included in the above table of incorporated places. New York City boroughs The following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000 but it is included for comparative purposes. Puerto Rico The following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census. The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or municipio, the place is located in is also included in the table below. The municipalities are what is thought of as ""incorporated places"" in Puerto Rico because there are no subordinate governments within them, only eight electoral districts which hold no administrative functions (the electoral districts are what generally constitute the census-designated places in this list below). No municipalities have a density over 10,000 as of the 2000 U.S. Census; the San Juan Municipio is the densest at 9,084.4 people per square mile. The Jayuya municipality is not part of any metropolitan area as it is only part of the Jayuya micropolitan area (see Puerto Rico census statistical areas). The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Northern Mariana Islands In the Northern Mariana Islands, there is one place that has more than 10,000 people per square mile: China Town, Northern Mariana Islands (in the 2010 U.S. Census). The other non-Puerto Rico U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) do not have any places with more than 10,000 people per square mile (as of the 2010 U.S. Census). China Town, Northern Mariana Islands is a Census-Designated Place; it is also a village within the larger municipality of Saipan. China Town would rank 105th if it were in the first table above. List of incorporated cities in the United States with over 75,000 residents Below is a list of the most densely populated cities in the United States which have a population density over 10,000 people per square mile and have a total population of over 75,000 according to the 2010 Census. This list relates to the first list, but excludes cities under 75,000.  Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Distributions The following distributions only include the 125 incorporated places with population densities over 10,000 people per square mile. They do not include the 36 census-designated places, the boroughs of New York City, or the 11 places in Puerto Rico with densities over 10,000. Metropolitan areas The following ranks United States metropolitan areas by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 within them. If two or more metropolitan areas have the same number of incorporated places, as is the case of the eight metros with one place, the metro areas are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the metro area. States and territories The following ranks the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 inhabited U.S. territories by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 people within them. The ""10,000+ places"" column only includes incorporated places, it does not include census-designated places (CDPs). If two or more states have the same number of places, as is the case of the 36 states that contain no incorporated places with a density over 10,000, the states are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the state. The density figures for the densest incorporated place within each state and territory are from the 2010 United States Census, and all the data for this ranking is from the U.S. Census Bureau. The first rank column ranks each state by the number of 10,000+ places in that state (New Jersey ranks first, California ranks second, etc.) The second rank column ranks the most densely populated place in each state or territory (Guttenberg, NJ ranks first, Kaser, NY ranks second, etc.) Hawaii officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the city of Honolulu is coextensive with Honolulu County, which makes up the whole island of Oahu. When the U.S. Census Bureau ranks incorporated places by population, it usually includes the Honolulu census-designated place, which is the urban center of Honolulu, in its ranking of incorporated places. Therefore, for this list of the densest incorporated places by state, the Honolulu CDP is considered the densest incorporated place in Hawaii. The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories are also included in this list. Puerto Rico also officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the lowest form of local government in Puerto Rico are the municipios, which are equivalent to counties. For this ranking, the municipios are counted as the incorporated places in Puerto Rico, and the San Juan Municipio is the densest. In American Samoa, each village is governed by a pulenu'u (the equivalent of a mayor) — as such, each village in American Samoa can be considered to be incorporated for the purposes of the table below. In the Northern Mariana Islands, each municipality (such as Saipan) is governed by a mayor, and so those municipalities can be considered incorporated — the villages in the Northern Mariana Islands are considered Census-Designated Places. In Guam, each village is governed by a mayor, and so those villages can be considered incorporated. For the purposes of the table below, the major towns of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Charlotte Amalie, Frederiksted and Christiansted) are considered to be incorporated. Note: this table contains data from the 2010 U.S. Census — because of this, data is more than 9 years old, and the current population density of each jurisdiction may have changed since then. Populations New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia are the only incorporated places in the United States that have a population over 1,000,000 and a population density over 10,000 people per square mile.

https://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/06/real-life-producer-couple-music-bank-1n2d-pds-revealed-to-have-gotten-married,Real life 'Producer' couple (Music Bank & 1N2D PD's) revealed to have gotten married,"The June 13 episode of KBS 2TV's 'Entertainment Weekly' featured a real life 'Producer' couple! The program revealed the couple got married after spending hours and hours working together, just like the on-air producers in 'Producer'. 'Music Bank' producer Shin Soo Jung had married her senior, Park In Seok, the current producer of '1 Night 2 Days.' She said, ""I married my senior. Because we spend so much time together... you have to marry someone who's next to you."" In the current popular drama 'Producer', Gong Hyo Jin is taking on the role as 'Music Bank' producer while Cha Tae Hyun takes on the role of a '1 Night 2 Days' producer. The storyline as of now draws a complicated four-way love line between Gong Hyo Jin, Kim Soo Hyun, Cha Tae Hyun, and IU.� However, viewers have speculated and questioned if the drama is actually based on this real-life love story and that Cha Tae Hyun and Gong Hyo Jin may very well end up together in the end.

The EP, released in April 2019, became the best-selling album in Korea of all time, with more than 3.2 million copies in less than a month. Including estimates based on illegal sales, Kim Gun-mo's 1995 studio album Wrongful Encounter is estimated to have sold at least 3.3 million copies. Of all 67 albums, which sold more than one million copies, all are by Korean artists with the exception of Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard (1992). Kim Gun-mo and Seo Taiji are the artists with the most million selling albums, having each six, followed by BTS and Exo with each five. Exo's first studio album, XOXO, became the first album released since 2001 to sell more than 1 million copies in 2013 and BTS' Love Yourself: Answer, became the first album to sell more than 2 million copies since 2000 in 2018. Between January 1999 and November 2008, the Music Industry Association of Korea (MIAK) charts were published monthly, with fifty chart positions and each album's detailed sales. The Korea Music Content Association (KMCA) introduced the Gaon Album Chart in February 2010, including a detailed breakdown of online chart data. Domestic music sales declined sharply in the 21st century. Sales certifications for albums are awarded by the KMCA, were introduced in April 2018, and can be awarded to every album released after January 1, 2018.

https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-men-in-us-wealth-gdp-bezos-gates-buffett-2019-1,The 5 richest men in the US have a staggering combined wealth of $435.4 billion. That's more than 2% of America's GDP.,"The five richest men in the US are worth a combined $435.4 billion, according to the Forbes 400 of 2019. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, is worth $114 billion. He's followed by Bill Gates at $106 billion; Warren Buffett at $80.8 billion; Mark Zuckerberg at $69.6 billion; and Larry Ellison at $65 billion. Their combined wealth equals more than 2% of the US GDP, which was $21.34 trillion in the second quarter of 2019. The five men are collectively worth about $20 billion more than they were this time last year, when Larry Page occupied the fifth spot instead of Larry Ellison. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The five richest men in the US are worth a mind-boggling combined $435.4 billion, according to the Forbes 400 ranking of 2019's richest Americans. And all but one of them made their fortunes in the tech industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tops the list with a net worth of $114 billion, followed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates ($106 billion), investor and Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett ($80.8 billion), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($69.6 billion), and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison ($65 billion), according to the Forbes ranking. Their combined fortune comes out to more than 2% of the US GDP, which was $21.34 trillion in the second quarter of 2019. (Exactly 2% of $21.34 trillion would be $426.8 billion.) A Business Insider analysis found that for a billionaire, buying a vacation to Bali is the equivalent of a typical American buying a candy bar. And that's based on a net worth of just $2 billion, the median fortune of a Forbes list billionaire. While these five men are the richest in the US, one European billionaire knocks Ellison off the list of five richest men in the world. Bernard Arnault, the French businessman who controls LVMH, is worth $91.9 billion, making him the third-richest person in the world after Bezos and Gates, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Forbes estimates his net worth at a slightly lower $91.4 billion, still well above Zuckerberg and Ellison. Read more: Bernard Arnault just finalized his $219 million pledge to help rebuild the Notre-Dame in Paris. Here's how the French billionaire makes and spends his $93 billion fortune. The US is the world's dominant country for billionaires, home to an estimated 705 billionaires, as Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower previously reported. New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have the highest concentration of billionaires in the country. China comes in second place, with 285 billionaires, but it may be catching up to the US. According to a recent PBS report, China is producing billionaires at a faster rate than any other country.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density,United States cities by population density,"The following is a list of incorporated places in the United States with a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is defined as a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been ""incorporated"" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated and so an ""incorporated place"" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township. The other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below. Incorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile The following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2010 U.S. Census, except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state, and ranked by total population; the population density for each place is also given in the lists. The population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles; the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below. The list below only includes incorporated places of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below. The District of Columbia would be included in the list, but Washington, D.C. misses the 10,000 mark as it has a population density of 9,800 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census (as of 2013 American Community Survey estimates, however, Washington now has a density of 10,528 people per square mile). Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Census-designated places The following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if it was included in the above table of incorporated places. New York City boroughs The following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000 but it is included for comparative purposes. Puerto Rico The following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census. The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or municipio, the place is located in is also included in the table below. The municipalities are what is thought of as ""incorporated places"" in Puerto Rico because there are no subordinate governments within them, only eight electoral districts which hold no administrative functions (the electoral districts are what generally constitute the census-designated places in this list below). No municipalities have a density over 10,000 as of the 2000 U.S. Census; the San Juan Municipio is the densest at 9,084.4 people per square mile. The Jayuya municipality is not part of any metropolitan area as it is only part of the Jayuya micropolitan area (see Puerto Rico census statistical areas). The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Northern Mariana Islands In the Northern Mariana Islands, there is one place that has more than 10,000 people per square mile: China Town, Northern Mariana Islands (in the 2010 U.S. Census). The other non-Puerto Rico U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) do not have any places with more than 10,000 people per square mile (as of the 2010 U.S. Census). China Town, Northern Mariana Islands is a Census-Designated Place; it is also a village within the larger municipality of Saipan. China Town would rank 105th if it were in the first table above. List of incorporated cities in the United States with over 75,000 residents Below is a list of the most densely populated cities in the United States which have a population density over 10,000 people per square mile and have a total population of over 75,000 according to the 2010 Census. This list relates to the first list, but excludes cities under 75,000.  Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Distributions The following distributions only include the 125 incorporated places with population densities over 10,000 people per square mile. They do not include the 36 census-designated places, the boroughs of New York City, or the 11 places in Puerto Rico with densities over 10,000. Metropolitan areas The following ranks United States metropolitan areas by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 within them. If two or more metropolitan areas have the same number of incorporated places, as is the case of the eight metros with one place, the metro areas are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the metro area. States and territories The following ranks the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 inhabited U.S. territories by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 people within them. The ""10,000+ places"" column only includes incorporated places, it does not include census-designated places (CDPs). If two or more states have the same number of places, as is the case of the 36 states that contain no incorporated places with a density over 10,000, the states are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the state. The density figures for the densest incorporated place within each state and territory are from the 2010 United States Census, and all the data for this ranking is from the U.S. Census Bureau. The first rank column ranks each state by the number of 10,000+ places in that state (New Jersey ranks first, California ranks second, etc.) The second rank column ranks the most densely populated place in each state or territory (Guttenberg, NJ ranks first, Kaser, NY ranks second, etc.) Hawaii officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the city of Honolulu is coextensive with Honolulu County, which makes up the whole island of Oahu. When the U.S. Census Bureau ranks incorporated places by population, it usually includes the Honolulu census-designated place, which is the urban center of Honolulu, in its ranking of incorporated places. Therefore, for this list of the densest incorporated places by state, the Honolulu CDP is considered the densest incorporated place in Hawaii. The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories are also included in this list. Puerto Rico also officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the lowest form of local government in Puerto Rico are the municipios, which are equivalent to counties. For this ranking, the municipios are counted as the incorporated places in Puerto Rico, and the San Juan Municipio is the densest. In American Samoa, each village is governed by a pulenu'u (the equivalent of a mayor) — as such, each village in American Samoa can be considered to be incorporated for the purposes of the table below. In the Northern Mariana Islands, each municipality (such as Saipan) is governed by a mayor, and so those municipalities can be considered incorporated — the villages in the Northern Mariana Islands are considered Census-Designated Places. In Guam, each village is governed by a mayor, and so those villages can be considered incorporated. For the purposes of the table below, the major towns of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Charlotte Amalie, Frederiksted and Christiansted) are considered to be incorporated. Note: this table contains data from the 2010 U.S. Census — because of this, data is more than 9 years old, and the current population density of each jurisdiction may have changed since then. Populations New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia are the only incorporated places in the United States that have a population over 1,000,000 and a population density over 10,000 people per square mile.

https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/11-huge-tower-blocks-could-1573711,11 huge tower blocks which could be built in Croydon in the coming years,"Croydon is seen by many as one of the brightest and most promising boroughs in London at present in terms of redevelopment. And it's hard to argue with that statement given the amount of tower blocks which are due to be built here in the coming years. From an enormous 68-storey skyscraper in the town centre to the world's largest prefabricated building, there are certainly some exciting plans to look forward too. Promoted Stories With that in mind, here's a roundup of some significant developments that will transform Croydon's skyline when completed. Plans to build two new blocks - one reaching 24 storeys high - consisting of nearly 200 homes in Croydon town centre were approved by Croydon Council last week. The council has given planning permission for Telereal Trillium, one of the UK's largest property companies, to start work on a new, residential-led regeneration development on Dingwall Road. The project will involve 181 new homes being built across two towers of 9 storeys and 24 storeys, plus a flexible commercial space on the ground, first and second floors which could include a new restaurant, café or bar. The homes will include 88 one-bed apartments, 81 two-bed apartments and 12 three-bed apartments. A truly enormous 68-storey skyscraper is set to tower over Croydon as the green light was given on the One Lansdowne development last year. Work on the huge project, delivered by Guildhose Rosepride in conjunction with the China Building Technique Group, is due to start in 2018. The developers expect work to begin at the site at 1 to 5 Lansdowne Road by the summer, with an expected finishing date of 2022. David Hudson, chief executive of Guildhouse UK, said: ""Peaking at 288 metres high, One Lansdowne will be visible from Piccadilly to Brighton, and will be a world-class building which really puts Croydon on the map."" The building would be the second tallest in Britain - towering over the 50-storey Canary Wharf and only the Shard, which stands at 95 floors and 310 metres, would be taller. A trio of towers is set to be built close to East Croydon station, providing 151 new homes. A tall building with three connecting blocks – one with nine-storeys, one with 20-storeys and another with 21-storeys – will be constructed on Addiscombe Grove. The flats - 112 one-bedroom, 39 two-bedroom and two three-bedroom - will be built and managed by Pocket, which specialises in small apartments for first-time buyers. No completion date has been given for the development but a planning condition states work must start within three years. Plans to build hundreds of homes in two huge towers next to East Croydon station were approved by Croydon Council last month. Developers Menta and Redrow were given permission to create 445 new homes in twin 25-storey towers - known as Morello North and Morello South - on Cherry Orchard Road by the council's planning committee on Thursday, April 19. The major Morello II project will also involve completing the public bridge link to East Croydon station and into central Croydon for people living on the Addiscombe side of the tracks. Out of the 445 new homes, 338 will be inside the two towers and the remaining 107 will be in a new building of between five and nine storeys. Property developer R&F Properties has £500 million plans to redevelop St George's Walk into a huge public square outside Croydon Town Hall, which includes constructing new shops and refurbishing the Nestlé building (officially known as St George's House) into three tower blocks with hundreds of flats. Planning permission has already been granted for the conversion of St George's House - more widely known as the Nestlé building - into flats. The 'wrap around' section at the bottom of the building will be demolished while the rest of the landmark structure will be refurbished to look like three individual towers of different heights. Recladding on the front will give the appearance of it becoming three towers. Original designs for the site on Park Lane included plans to build two new towers, of 25 and 35 storeys, with more than 820 flats among new routes lined with shops linking George Street, High Street and Katharine Street, as well as the public square on a pedestrianised Katharine Street. While it is not yet known when work on the development will start, the recent submitted planning application to partly demolish the former Blue Orchid nightclub is a clear sign that it could be sooner rather than later. A huge 44-storey block of more than 540 flats is going to be built opposite East Croydon Station after planning permission was given for work to start on the vacant former Essex House site in November last year. The new double-tower skyscraper, which has structures of 44 and 38 storeys , will contain 546 flats as well as ground-floor shops and offices. Two rooftop gardens for residents on the 27th and 43rd floor, as well as an enclosed winter garden on the mezzanine floor, are additionally included in the proposal. The tower is set to be the world's largest prefabricated building. Ruskin Square will feature up to two million square feet of new shops, offices and homes, when fully finished, with just two tower blocks completed so far. HM Revenue and Customs moved into One Ruskin Square last year, meaning around 2,500 civil servants are now based in the new development next to East Croydon station. The 25-year agreement means HMRC have taken up all 184,000 square feet of the office space in the nine-storey building, which is next to platform 1 at East Croydon station. Two more tower blocks are subject to planning permission, but plans to build one minimum 12-storey and one minimum eight-storey building are well underway. A planning application has been submitted by Brick by Brick - a Croydon Council owned company - to build the new homes on land between Belgrave Road and Grosvenor Road. If plans are approved, it would give the go-ahead for the redevelopment of the existing car parks and open space on to incorporate the erection of one seventeen-storey tower and two four-storey buildings comprising of 102 residential units. The plan has been put forward to “improve” the area, with a report claiming it is currently subject to anti-social behaviour and is under-utilised. The plan proposes to build 61 one-bedroom flats, 38 two-bedroom flats and three three-bed flats. Ambitious plans to develop College Green and Fairfield into a vibrant destination for arts, education and culture were given the go-ahead last year. The £30 million redevelopment plan will see more than 2,000 new homes, various new high-quality public spaces, a brand new college, a 2,000 sq metre art gallery, new shops and office space, all with the refurbished Fairfield Halls at its heart, be built. The site, which is nicknamed as the Cultural Quarter, covers the area of land inside George Street, Park Lane, Barclay Road, and the Brighton Mainline railway line. Developers made a pre-planning application asking for permission to bulldoze the council car park in Wandle Road to make way for more than 120 flats in November last year. The proposed double-tower skyscraper, which has towers of 25 and five storeys, will contain 128 flats as well as 950 square metres of space to be used as either offices, shops or restaurants if planning permission is approved. The towers would replace the current open-air surface car park, which contains 255 parking bays that are currently reserved for Croydon Council staff until 4pm on weekdays, and can be used by the public at other times. The plans, submitted by Croydon Council's development company Brick by Brick, show that the proposed flats are intended for rental only and consist of 56 one-bedroom properties, 58 two-bedroom properties and 14 three-bedroom properties. A planning application to build a block of flats on 5 – 9 Surrey Street, consisting of 55 homes, was submitted to Croydon Council in March this year. The proposed block of flats is eight storeys tall at its highest point and would contain a space for a food vendor on the ground floor. The application comes after South Croydon company Regent Land and Developments submitted a pre-planning application last May to bulldoze the building which houses the hub and build a block of flats in its place. The existing building is also home to the Sam 99p store on Surrey Street.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_wooden_buildings,Tallest wooden buildings,"Several wooden skyscraper designs have been designed and built, with the tallest currently being the Sanctuary of Truth, a 105-meter high temple in Pattaya, Thailand. The previous record holder, the 67-meter high Pagoda of Fogong Temple, was built 900 years ago.  Wooden skyscrapers are estimated to be around a quarter of the weight of an equivalent reinforced-concrete structure as well as reducing the building carbon footprint by 60–75%. Buildings have been designed using cross-laminated timber (CLT) which gives a higher rigidity and strength to wooden structures. CLT panels are prefabricated and can therefore speed up building time. The tallest actual wooden non-building structure is Gliwice Radio Tower (118 metres), the tallest ever-built wooden non-building structure was the tower of Muhlacker radio transmitter ( 190 metres, destroyed in 1945).",Tallest unfinished/proposed wooden buildings,0.53771,"[['Skyscraper','Height (m)','Floors','City','Dates','Status']['W350 Project','350','70','Tokyo','2041','Planned']['Oakwood Tower','304.8','80','Barbican','','Planned: Research Phase']['River Beech Tower','228','80','Chicago','','Proposed']['The Dutch Mountains I','150','','Eindhoven','2022 - 2023','Planned']['Timber Towers','','40, 60','Philadelphia','','Planned: Demonstration / Research Phase']['Sidewalks Lab','','50','Toronto','','Planned']['Trätoppen','133','40','Stockholm','','Proposed']['The Dutch Mountains II','110','','Eindhoven','2022 - 2023','Planned']['The Spar','91.44','48','Portland','','Proposed: Research Phase']['HoHo Wien','84','24','Vienna','','Under Construction']['Baobab','','35','Paris','','Proposed']['CF Møller Wooden','','34 x 4','Stockholm','','Proposed']['Abebe Court Tower','','26','Lagos','','Proposal']['Urban Lung','','25','Cardiff','','Proposal']['Kulturhus','76','19','Skellefteå','2019','Developer appointed']['U of T Academic Tower','74.5','14','Toronto','2019','To be built']['HAUT','73','21','Amsterdam','2020','Proposed: In sales phase']['Ascent','72.5','21','Wisconsin','2019','Planned']['Michael Green','','20','Vancouver','','Proposal']['Tham & Videgård','','20','Frihamnen','','Proposed']['Terrace House','71','19','Vancouver','','Under Construction']['Tree Tower','62','18','Toronto','','Proposed']['Tour Hypérion','57','17','Bordeaux','Estimated 2020','Proposed']['5 King Tower','52','','Brisbane','','Proposed']['Vertical Village','50','17','Ile de France','','To be built']['WoodUp','50','18','Paris 13','2021','Planned']['Light House','','14','Joensuu','Estimated 2019','Under Construction']['The Arbour','52.5','12','Toronto','Estimated 2024','Planned']['Framework','24+','12','Portland','','Approved']['Horizons bois','','12','Rennes','','Proposed']['Sensation','38','8, 11','Strasbourg','2019','Under Construction']['Riverfront Square','','6,8,11','Newark','','Searching tenants']['SKAIO','34','10','Heilbronn','2019','Under Construction']['PuuCity (WoodCity)','','8','Helsinki','','Under Construction']['Dutch Mountain','','7','Veldhoven','2021','Cancelled']['80 Atlantic','28','5','Toronto','2019','Under Construction']]",Skyscraper|Height (m)|Floors|City|Dates|Status
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash.asp,Stock Market Crash,"A stock market crash is a rapid and often unanticipated drop in stock prices. A stock market crash can be a side effect of major catastrophic events, economic crisis or the collapse of a long-term speculative bubble. Reactionary public panic about a stock market crash can also be a major contributor to it. Although there is no specific threshold for stock market crashes, they are generally considered as abrupt double-digit percentage drop in a stock index over the course of a few days. Well-known US stock market crashes include the market crash of 1929, which resulted from economic decline and panic selling and sparked the Great Depression, and Black Monday (1987), which was also largely caused by mass panic. Another major crash occurred in 2008 in the housing and real estate market and resulted in what we now refer to as the Great Recession. High-frequency trading was determined to be a cause of the flash crash that occurred in May 2010 and wiped off trillions of dollars from stock prices. Stock market crashes are an abrupt double-digit drop in stock prices. Several measures have been put in place to prevent stock market crashes. Examples of these measures include circuit breakers and trading curbs to lessen the effect of an abrupt drop in prices. Since the crashes of 1929 and 1987, safeguards have been put in place to prevent crashes due to panicked stockholders selling their assets. Such safeguards include trading curbs, or circuit breakers, which prevent any trade activity whatsoever for a certain period of time following a sharp decline in stock prices, in hopes of stabilizing the market and preventing it from falling further. For example, the United States has a set of thresholds in place to guard against crashes. If the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falls 2,400 points (threshold 2) before 1:00 pm, the market will be frozen for an hour. If it falls below 3,600 points (threshold 3), the market closes for the day. Other countries have similar measures in place. The problem with this method today is that if one stock exchange closes, shares can often still be bought or sold in other exchanges, which can cause the preventative measures to backfire. Markets can also be stabilized by large entities purchasing massive quantities of stocks, essentially setting an example for individual traders and curbing panic selling. However, these methods are not only unproven, they may not be effective. In one famous example, the Panic of 1907, a 50 percent drop in stocks in New York set off a financial panic that threatened to bring down the financial system. JP Morgan, the famous financier and investor, convinced New York bankers to step in and use their personal and institutional capital to shore up markets. Stock market crashes wipe out equity-investment values and are most harmful to those who rely on investment returns for retirement. Although the collapse of equity prices can occur over a day or a year, crashes are often followed by a recession or depression. For a detailed lesson on market crashes and a history lesson on the most famous crashes from around the world, read The Greatest Market Crashes",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_self-driving_car_fatalities,Self-driving car fatalities,"Since 2013, when self-driving cars first began appearing in large numbers on public roadways, a primary goal of manufacturers has been to create an autonomous car system that is clearly and demonstrably safer than an average human-controlled car. Whether that will be possible in the real world without sacrificing even more human lives is a controversial topic, especially in light of accidents and fatalities resulting from system glitches. There are currently five levels of automated driving, of which two are considered autonomous (or self) driving (Level 4 and Level 5). Tesla Autopilot is a Level 2 automated driving system. One of the key metrics for comparing the safety levels for autonomously controlled car systems versus human controlled car systems is the number of fatalities per 100,000,000 miles (160,000,000 kilometres) driven. Cars driven under traditional human control are currently involved in approximately 1.18 fatalities for every 100,000,000 mi (160,000,000 km) driven. According to many automotive safety experts, much more data is yet required before any such clear and demonstrably higher levels of safety can be convincingly provided. To demonstrate reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries, autonomous vehicles have to be driven hundreds of millions more miles in full autonomous mode. As of February 2018, autonomous vehicles from Waymo (the Google Self-Driving Car Project) have covered 5 million miles (8 million kilometres) with the presence of a human driver who monitors and overrides the autonomous mode to improve safety. According to reports, human intervention for autonomous vehicles was needed every 13 to 5,600 miles (21 to 9,000 km) on average. On December 20, 2018, Uber returned self-driving cars to the roads in public testing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, following the pedestrian fatality on March 18. Uber said that it received authorization from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Uber said that it was also pursuing deploying cars on roads in San Francisco, California and Toronto, Ontario. The NTSB is currently still investigating accidents caused by Tesla's Autopilot. Level 3 fatalities A Level 3 autonomous driving system would occasionally expect a driver to take over control. Level 2 fatalities Level 2 is considered automated driving, but not autonomous driving. A Level 2 driving system expects a driver to be fully aware at any time of the driving and traffic situation and be able to take over any moment. As of August 9th, 2019, there are four confirmed Level 2 fatalities, each of which involved Autopilot.",List of known autonomous car fatalities (occurring while autonomous-system acknowledged to have been engaged),0.456914,"[['Date','Incident no','Country','City','State/county/province','No. of fatalities','System manufacturer','Vehicle Type','Distance driven by the system at time of incident','Notes']['18 March 2018','1','United States of America (USA)','Tempe','Arizona','1','Uber','Refitted Volvo','—','Pedestrian fatality.']]",Date|Incident no|Country|City|State/county/province|No. of fatalities|System manufacturer|Vehicle Type|Distance driven by the system at time of incident|Notes
https://www.modernghana.com/news/916140/ghana-now-has-16-regions.html,Ghana Now Has 16 Regions,"The number of administrative regions in Ghana has finally increased from 10 to 16 following the successful presentations of the Constitutional Instruments (CI) on the creation of the six new regions. The new regions are Oti, Western North, North East, Ahafo, Savannah and Bono East Regions. Bono East's capital is Techiman; Western North has Sefwi Wiaso; North East's capital is Nalerigu and Savannah has Damongo as its capital. For Oti Region, Dambai was chosen by President Akufo-Addo as its capital. The creations of the regions bring to an end decades of petitions calling for the formation of the regions. The chiefs and people from the Oti Region, for instance, started demanding the creation of the region as far back as 1954, with the head of Western North delegation to the Jubilee House, President of the Western Regional House of Chiefs, Ogyeahohoo Yaw Gyebi II, lamenting that successive governments since the 1950s paid what he termed as lip-service to the creation of the Western North Region. The six new regions were carved from four already existing regions, namely Brong Ahafo, which has been split into three; Northern Region, also split into three; Western Region and Volta Region. Western North was carved from Western Region, Oti from Volta, Bono East and Ahafo from Brong Ahafo, and Savannah and North East from Northern Region. President Akufo-Addo presented the Constitutional Instruments to the chiefs from the regions, beginning from Tuesday, February 12, 2019, at the Jubilee House and ended on Friday , February 15, with the Oti Region. The oresident reiterated his government's pledge to invest in the development of the regions, saying GH¢20 million each has been set aside as seed fund for the six regions. He assured the chiefs and people of the regions that developmental projects would be spread equitably and that governance would now be brought more closer to the people.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_GDP_growth,European Union member states by GDP growth,"This is a list of estimates of the real gross domestic product growth rate (not rebased GDP) in the 28 European Union member states for the latest years recorded in the CIA World Factbook.

https://www.space.com/41447-parker-solar-probe-fastest-spacecraft-ever.html,NASA Is About to Launch the Fastest Spacecraft in History. Target: The Sun!,"Update for Aug. 11: NASA and the United Launch Alliance have postponed the Parker Solar Probe launch by at least 24 hours, to Aug. 12, due to an issue with the probe's Delta IV Heavy rocket. Read our full story here. Early tomorrow morning (Aug. 11), weather permitting, NASA will launch its newest spacecraft, called the Parker Solar Probe, aboard a huge United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket — and by December 2024, it will become the fastest spacecraft ever. That's when the probe will reach its closest point to the sun, coming within 3.83 million miles (6 million kilometers) of our star. At that point, the spacecraft will be speeding along at a whopping 430,000 mph (692,000 km/h). On Earth, that would be the equivalent of traveling from Washington, DC, to Tokyo in less than a minute — or from DC to Philadelphia in less than a second. But the team behind the spacecraft is surprisingly blasé about the record-breaking feat. ""Designing something to go fast in space is pretty much the same as you would design it to go slow in space; space has nothing to really impede its progress,"" Parker Solar Probe project manager Andrew Driesman, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said during a NASA news conference yesterday (Aug. 9). ""The spacecraft doesn't know it's going fast."" [The Greatest Missions to the Sun Nevertheless, it won't be entirely smooth sailing, since the probe won't be the only thing moving incredibly quickly. The Parker Solar Probe will also be surrounded by what scientists call a hypervelocity dust environment — a slew of tiny, fast-moving particles, some of which will inevitably bang into the spacecraft. The probe carries Kevlar blankets to protect itself from those impacts. During its closest approach to the sun, the Parker Solar Probe will leave other speedy spacecraft eating metaphorical dust. For comparison, the Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched back in 1977, is currently traveling at about 38,000 mph (61,000 km/h), according to NASA — less than 10 percent of the Parker Solar Probe's peak speed. When it slipped into orbit around Jupiter in July 2016, NASA's Juno probe briefly clocked in at 165,000 mph (266,000 km/h), making it the fastest spacecraft to date. That was achievable thanks, in part, to the gas giant's own gravity — which some sticklers claim is cheating. However, in terms of so-called heliocentric velocity only — the speed with regard to the sun, without the influence of planets — two other spacecraft currently hold the record: Helios I and II, two 1970s missions that slipped closer to the sun than Mercury is to our star, reaching speeds of about 150,000 mph (241,000 km/h). But because things orbit faster the closer in, sailing within 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of the visible surface of the sun means that the Parker Solar Probe will almost triple that speed. Better wave goodbye to it while you can.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_chart_achievements_and_milestones,Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones,"This is a comprehensive listing that highlights significant achievements and milestones based upon Billboard magazine's singles charts, most notably the Billboard Hot 100. This list spans the period from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The Billboard Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular music chart in the United States. Prior to the creation of the Hot 100, Billboard published four singles charts: ""Best Sellers in Stores"", ""Most Played by Jockeys"", ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" and ""The Top 100"". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations. All items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts). All-Time Hot 100 achievements (1958–2018) In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists. In 2013, Billboard revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition. In 2015, Billboard revised the rankings again. In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the Billboard chart's 60th anniversary. Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018. Also shown are the artists placing the most songs on the overall ""all-time"" top 100 song list.

When the songs originally charted in 1984, their chart positions in their final week on the Hot 100 were well below the top 10. Prior to 2008, the biggest drop off the Hot 100 was ""Nights in White Satin"" by The Moody Blues, which ranked at #17 in its final week on the chart in December 1972. This high drop-off position was matched in January 1975 by ""Junior's Farm"" by Paul McCartney and Wings. The record descent held for over three decades.  Each song above dropped off the Hot 100 upon four or fewer weeks; ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Junior's Farm"" dropped off after 18 and 12 weeks, respectively. Source: Seasonal songs During the holiday season, which includes Christmas, these songs regularly appear on the Hot 100, generally departing from the chart after the holiday season ends. In recent years, seasonal songs have reached into the top ten, and in 2019, for only the second time ever on the Hot 100 (the first since 1958), made it to number one. This has led to all-time records for dropping off the Hot 100, including from number one, as the songs depart the chart regardless of their final chart positions during the season.

Billboard now credits the dual #1 Presley single ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" as a single chart entity, and credits Presley with 17 number one singles. ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" spent 11 weeks at #1, ""Hound Dog"" for 6 weeks, ""Don't Be Cruel"" for 5 weeks. Many chart statisticians however, such as Joel Whitburn, still list Presley as having 18 number ones.  Source: Most cumulative weeks at number one † Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Presley is sometimes credited with an ""80th week"" that occurred when ""All Shook Up"" spent a ninth week on top of the ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" chart. Although Billboard's chart statistician Joel Whitburn still counts this 80th week based on preexisting research, Billboard magazine itself has since revised its methodology and officially credits Presley with 79 weeks. Much of Presley's total factors in pre-Hot 100 data. If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Fergie, if Black Eyed Peas is included, this would put Fergie on the list with 34 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Michael Jackson, if The Jackson 5, which would also be later known as The Jacksons is included, this would give Michael Jackson 47 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For singer Beyoncé, if Destiny's Child is included, this would give Beyoncé 59 cumulative weeks at #1. All six weeks from the Perfect duet with Ed Sheeran are also included. Note: For singer Diana Ross, if The Supremes are included, this would give Diana Ross 42 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For each of the Beatles: If John Lennon's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give John Lennon 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Paul McCartney's total weeks were to include the Beatles, as well as Wings, this would give Paul McCartney 89 cumulative weeks at #1. If George Harrison's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give George Harrison 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Ringo Starr's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give Ringo Starr 61 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For rapper Drake if the track ""Sicko Mode"" is included, this would put Drake on the list with 50 weeks at #1. Most consecutive number-one singles Houston's ""Thinking About You"" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio. Likewise, Perry's ""Not Like the Movies"" and ""Circle the Drain"" were only promotional singles, not radio singles. With the streak spanning from her debut single ""Vision of Love"" until ""Emotions,"" Mariah Carey became the first artist in Hot 100 history to have their first 5 solo singles reach #1 on the chart.

The song which established this record for her was ""I Will Follow Him"", which reached #1 on April 27, 1963. Fred Stobaugh (age 96 years, 23 days) is the oldest living artist to chart on the Hot 100. He was featured on the Green Shoe Studio song ""Oh Sweet Lorriane"", which ranked at #42 on September 14, 2013. The previous record was held by Tony Bennett, who was 85 years, 59 days old when his song ""Body and Soul"", a duet with Amy Winehouse, ranked at #87 on October 1, 2011. French-born Jordy Lemoine (age 5 years, 156 days) is the youngest artist to chart on the Hot 100. He established the record when his song ""Dur dur d'être bébé! (It's Tough to Be a Baby)"", where he is credited simply as Jordy, entered the chart on June 19, 1993. Gap records The longest gap between #1 hits on the Hot 100 for an artist is 24 years, 355 days by Cher. Her single ""Believe"" hit #1 on March 13, 1999, her first time on top since ""Dark Lady"" on March 23, 1974. The record for the longest wait from an artist's Hot 100 debut entry to its first #1 belongs to Santana, with 30 years between the time he first cracked the Hot 100 with ""Jingo"" (October 25, 1969) and the first of 12 weeks at #1 with ""Smooth,"" featuring Rob Thomas (October 23, 1999). When ""4th Dimension"" by Kids See Ghosts featuring Louis Prima debuted at #42 for the week of June 23, 2018, Prima became the artist with the longest overall span of singles on the Hot 100 – 57 years, 130 days on account of his single ""Wonderland by Night"" which last appeared at #89 on the Hot 100, dated February 13, 1961. Bobby Helms' ""Jingle Bell Rock"" holds the record for the longest trip to the Hot 100's top 10: 60 years and two weeks. It first appeared on the Hot 100 dated December 22, 1958 and reached the top 10 on the chart dated January 5, 2019 peaking at #8. Additionally, as his song ""Dreams"" debuted on the third Hot 100 ever, (dated August 18, 1958) Helms subsequently ends the longest wait for an artist's first top 10: 60 years, four months and two weeks. Burl Ives holds the record for the longest break between Hot 100 top 10's: He returned to the top 10 after 56 years, seven months and two weeks, when ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" reached #10 on the chart dated January 5, 2019. Mariah Carey holds the record gap between first and most recent No. 1 on the Hot 100 over the longest period of time: 29 years, four months and two weeks, dating to her first week at No. 1 on the chart dated August 4, 1990, with ""Vision of Love"" to her most recent No. 1, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", which reached number one on the chart dated December 21, 2019. Cher previously held this record over a period of 27 years and 5 months, ranging from the first of two weeks at No. 1 for ""Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves"" on November 6, 1971 to the last week at No. 1 for ""Believe"" on April 3, 1999. This record only counts Cher's solo career: if her time as part of Sonny & Cher is included, her span would cover 33 years, seven months and two weeks, starting with the first of three weeks at No. 1 for ""I Got You Babe"" with Sonny on August 14, 1965. Album achievements Most number-one singles from one album Source: Saturday Night Fever generated number-one singles for two different artists: ""How Deep Is Your Love"", ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Night Fever"" by the Bee Gees; and ""If I Can't Have You"" by Yvonne Elliman. Katy Perry's Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was a reissue of the Teenage Dream album, and featured an additional single, ""Part Of Me"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This brings her actual total to six. However, this does not count since the single comes from a reissue of the album and not the original release. Most top ten singles from one album Source: † Waiting to Exhale generated top ten singles for five different artists: ""Exhale (Shoop Shoop)"" and ""Count on Me"" by Whitney Houston (the latter with CeCe Winans), ""Not Gon' Cry"" by Mary J.

Record includes these five 1965 A-sides and ""We Can Work It Out"", which hit #1 in January 1966. Source: Selected additional Hot 100 achievements The first #1 song on the Hot 100 was ""Poor Little Fool"" by Ricky Nelson (August 4, 1958). The shortest #1 song of all time is ""Stay"" by Maurice Williams And The Zodiacs. It runs for a length of 1 minute, 38 seconds. It topped the Hot 100 for one week on November 21, 1960. The #1 song in the first week Billboard incorporated sales and airplay data from Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems was ""Set Adrift on Memory Bliss"" by P.M. Dawn (November 30, 1991). The #1 song in the first week Billboard allowed songs without a commercial single release to chart on the Hot 100 was ""I'm Your Angel"" by R. Kelly and Céline Dion (December 5, 1998). Though the song was making its first appearance on the Hot 100 that week, Billboard did not consider it a debut at #1, since it appeared on unpublished test charts prior to the allowance of airplay-only songs on the main chart. ""I'm Your Angel"" also entered the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart that week at #1, so it would have been ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 before then. The first ""airplay-only"" song to reach #1 (no points from a commercial single release) was ""Try Again"" by Aaliyah (June 17, 2000). Drake holds the record for the most entries in the Hot 100 during a one-week period, with 27 on the July 14, 2018 chart. The Beatles had long held this record, occupying 14 positions on the Hot 100 dated April 11, 1964, a feat unmatched for nearly 51 years. On March 7, 2015, Drake tied the Beatles mark, and he equaled it again on October 17 that year. Justin Bieber then reset the record to 17 on December 5, 2015, before Drake reclaimed the record with 20 on May 21, 2016, and broke his own record with 27 on July 14, 2018. Drake also holds the record for the most debuting entries on a Hot 100 chart by any artist, with 22 on July 14, 2018. Taylor Swift is the record-holder among female artists for the most simultaneous entries in the Hot 100, with 18 on the September 7, 2019 chart. Previous record holders were Billie Eilish (14), Cardi B (13), Ariana Grande (12), and Beyoncé (12). Ariana Grande is the record-holder among female artists with the most songs charting in the top 40 simultaneously, with 11 on the February 23, 2019 chart. The Beatles are the only artists to simultaneously hold the top 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 albums chart. They achieved this feat for nine consecutive weeks, from February 29, 1964, to April 25, 1964. For the first five weeks of that run, through March 28, 1964, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You"" were the #1 and #2 singles (which swapped positions during March 1964), while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles held the top 2 spots on the albums charts. For the remaining weeks of the run, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and their cover of ""Twist and Shout"" were the #1 and #2 singles, while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles continued their reign as the top 2 albums. Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney hold the record of writing all of the Top 3 singles for one week. The Gibbs co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 18, 1978 – #1 ""Night Fever"" and #2 ""Stayin' Alive"" for the Bee Gees, and #3 ""Emotion"" for Samantha Sang. Lennon and McCartney co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 14, 1964 – #1 ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", #2 ""She Loves You"", and #3 ""Please Please Me"", all for The Beatles. They continued this record the following week of March 21, 1964, when ""She Loves You"" switched places with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". The Black Eyed Peas hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time at #1 on the Hot 100, a total of 26 consecutive weeks from April to October 2009. ""Boom Boom Pow"" spent the first 12 weeks on top, with ""I Gotta Feeling"" taking over for the remaining 14 weeks. Prior to August 2009, Usher held this record, spending 19 consecutive weeks on top of the chart in 2004 with ""Yeah!"" (12 weeks at #1) and ""Burn"" (first 7 of its 8 total weeks at #1). On December 4, 2010, Rihanna's ""Only Girl (In the World)"" reached the top spot two weeks after ""What's My Name?"", becoming the first time in Hot 100 history that an album's debut single hit #1 after the second single did. Ed Sheeran became the first artist to debut more than one song in the top 10 for the same week. On the chart dated January 28, 2017, ""Shape of You"" debuted at #1, while ""Castle on the Hill"" entered at #6. Drake later achieved this feat on three separate occasions, doing so on April 8, 2017, February 3, 2018, and July 14, 2018. In the latter week, Drake broke the record by debuting four songs in the top 10. Drake is the only artist to have a number-one debut replace another number-one debut. He did this April 21, 2018, when ""Nice For What"" replaced ""God's Plan"" at the summit, after the latter had spent eleven weeks on top. Drake holds the record for being on the Hot 100 for the most consecutive weeks. He placed at least one song, either in a lead or featured role, on every chart from his debut on May 23, 2009, to August 19, 2017, for a total of 431 weeks in a row. Ariana Grande is the only artist to have the lead single from each of her first five albums debut in the Hot 100's top 10. On July 14, 2018, Drake set the record for the most songs in the top ten at once, with seven. The Beatles had previously held the record, since 1964, with five entries. Ariana Grande is the first artist whose first two number-one songs both debuted at the top. She achieved this with the songs ""Thank U, Next"" and ""7 Rings"", on the charts dated November 17, 2018 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Mariah Carey is the first artist to have a number-one single in four different decades after ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" topped the chart in January 2020 for a third consecutive week.

However, serious questions remain about the weapons' overall reliability, issues The War Zone was first to report, as well as the legality of more widespread use of hollow point ammunition that is likely to accompany the guns. Earlier in March 2018, Sig Sauer told Military.com that all the branches of the US military, including the US Coast Guard, were planning to purchase variants of the Modular Handgun System, or MHS. This followed that outlet's earlier report that the US Marine Corps had specifically ask for funds to the purchase 35,000 of the pistols in its 2019 fiscal year budget request. In January 2017, the Army handed the Swiss-headquartered gunmaker a contract worth up to $580 million for up to 195,000 guns, including full size M17 and compact M18 versions, as well as various parts and support services. The MHS pistols are all variants of the company's commercial P320 design. “All services have been involved in MHS since its inception ... and they have all committed to ordering guns,” Tom Taylor, Sig Sauer's Executive Vice President for Sales and Chief Marketing Officer told Military.com in a statement. “The US Marine Corps, US Air Force, US Navy, and US Coast Guard all have orders that will be fielded starting later this year and early next year.” Taylor did not say what the value of these orders was, in part or in total, or how many pistols each service had committed to buy. The Marine Corps is the only service to have included any clear mention of MHS pistol purchases in its proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal cycle. The two Army Modular Handgun System pistols, the compact M18, left, and the full-size M17, right. It's also not clear if some of the Army's 195,000 guns are actually slated to go to other branches of the US military already. “The other military services, who were involved in the entire acquisition process including source selection, can also procure XM17/XM18 Modular Handgun Systems under the Army contract with Sig Sauer,” Debra Dawson, a spokesperson for the Army's Program Executive Office Soldier, which is overseeing the MHS program, explained to Military.com. It is definitely true that all the services have been actively considering following the Army in acquiring the new pistols since the MHS program began in 2008. This project followed the failure of previous joint service handgun program called the Joint Combat Handgun. The desire for standardization makes perfect sense, especially when it comes to systems like handguns, which see widespread and varied use across different components of all the services. A common system inherently reduces the strain on maintenance and logistics chains and allows the different branches to reduce costs through large, bulk purchases of spare parts and ammunition. The goal of the MHS program was also to select a gun that could be reconfigured to some degree with relative ease or was otherwise available in a number of different subvariants that had high commonality in parts and basic controls. The latter part helps reduce training requirements since the manual of arms – the basic actions of firing the weapon, operating various features, and remediate jams or other malfunctions – remains the same regardless of the pistol's exact configuration. An array of items issued to Army soldiers along with the M17 pistol, at center, including different polymer frames with different grip sizes at lower right, holsters and magazine pouches along the top, magazines of differing sizes below the gun, and the operator's manual. This was the same logic behind the rest of the US military's decision to adopt the Beretta M9 after the Army selected it as its standard service pistol in 1985. These guns, in turn, were supposed to replace the iconic Colt M1911 series, which had been in service in some form or another since World War II. The problem, of course, was that the M9 program became mired in controversy, first because of alleged improprieties in the contracting process and then because of quality control issues. To try and counter the claims that it had unfairly favored Beretta's entry, the Army even re-ran the competition, but Sig Sauer, who had protested the original results, refused to compete and Beretta won out again. The service then had to spend a significant amount to have the Italian gunmaker fix the pistols it had already supplied to prevent malfunctions that had sent more than a dozen people to the hospital with serious injuries A US Marine loads an M9 pistol. On top of that, it turned out that the different services, as well as various components within them, had a host of requirements the M9 simply could not satisfy. Its large size in particular made it unsuitable for any units with concealed carry requirements, prompting the Army to almost immediately adopt the compact Sig Sauer P228 as the M11. Every service has since purchased small numbers of handguns to supplement or outright supplant the M9 in various roles. The Navy, thanks in no small part to the SEALs, had no less than 10 different pistols in inventory by 2016, plus other assorted “Cats & Dogs,” according to one briefing. A slide from an official 2016 US Navy briefing showing the pistols it had in service at that point, as well as other ""Cats & Dogs."" The Marines even bought modernized M1911s and now expects the MHS to replace those, its M9s, and a small number of Glocks that it just began issuing to various specialized units in 2017. It seems almost certain that there are a host of other types handguns sitting in armories across the services. There remains a very real chance that Sig Sauer's pistols, somewhat ironically given the company's previous history with the M9 program, could end up facing at least some of the same issues. According to a Pentagon report earlier in 2018, during Army tests, both the M17 and M18 experienced significant reliability issues, especially while using standard ball ammunition. You can read about these malfunctions in detail here A US Marine trains with an M45A1 Close Quarters Battle Pistol, a modernized derivative of the M1911, in 2013. Both PEO Soldier and Sig Sauer have defended the guns since then, saying they are ""confident"" in the pistols ability to perform adequately in the field. At the time of writing, though, the Army had not responded to our questions about whether it had fixed or was in the process of fixing the problems the Pentagon's top test and evaluation office noted in its annual review. Perhaps more importantly, the service also did not respond to requests to explain what the legal rationale is behind issuing cartridges with hollow point bullets as the standard ammunition for the weapon. The Hague Convention of 1899 bans any bullet that has features that cause it to deliberately expand from combat use. While the United States has not signed or ratified the particular portion of the agreement dealing with expanding projectiles, it has historically followed its provisions nonetheless. MHS pistol magazines loaded with hollow pound rounds during a test. The US military has argued that it could use those rounds when there is a “clear military necessity” and some special operations forces already issue hollow point pistol rounds, as well as rifle cartridges with deliberately fragmenting bullets, with this justification in mind. However, it did not appear that this argument extended to regular use of hollow points and there is a concern that in using this ammunition routinely, the United States could open itself unnecessarily to accusations of war crimes. It's also just not clear whether or not the MHS will truly have the flexibility to meet all the necessary operational requirements across the services, including continued concealed carry demands among internal law enforcement units and special operations forces. For years now, Glock pistols, the Glock 19 especially, have been a favorite among special operators in particular because of their slim profile. There is no indication that US Special Operations Command plans to transition to the MHS entirely. A US Marine fires a Glock 19. The Coast Guard will also present a potentially complicated case, as it occupies an obtuse bureaucratic position as a uniformed military service within the Department of Homeland Security. DHS has adopted the .40 Smith & Wesson, rather than the US military standard 9mm, as the standard pistol caliber across its components, to include the Coast Guard. The Sig Sauer P320 can be readily rechambered for the .40 caliber round, which should make that less of an issue, but it will still reduce the commonality between the Coast Guard's guns and those in other military branches. Unless other components of DHS decide to acquire versions of the Swiss pistol as well, it will also make it more difficult for them to source spare parts and other services through that department. A member of the US Coast Guard fires a .40 Smith and Wesson Sig Sauer P229, one of the pistols that service could replace with a variant of the MHS. The Army and Sig Sauer, along with the other branches, will have to take these various issues into account in order to avoid the same pitfalls they experienced with the M9. Otherwise, the services could easily end up again with the same kind of unwieldy mix of guns that the MHS program was supposed to replace in the first place.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate,Countries by firearm-related death rate,"This is a historical list of countries by firearm-related death rate per 100,000 population in the listed year.

https://hype.my/2019/168682/asian-horror-movies-2019,6 Asian Horror Movies That Will Keep You Awake At Night In 2019,"When it comes to horror flicks, there's no denying that Asian countries have the upper hand over their Western counterparts. While scary movies like “The Exorcist” and “Friday the 13th” was terrifying, “Ju-on” and the “Ring” was a whole new level. (We still get nightmares about it, shhh!) According to an annual report by Stephen Follows, it seems like the horror movie genre has gained popularity over the past decade. Twenty years ago, the genre only accounted for 4.3% of all movies made. Whereas, this past decade saw an increase in the numbers, accounting for 12.4% of all the feature films that were released in 2017. So, if you're a sucker for Asian horror movies, brace yourself as here's five Asian horror movie that is slated for release this year. The movie centres on a group of individuals who are disturbed by a supernatural being. They enter a haunted house to get to the bottom of this, in hopes of finding a solution to this problem. However, horror strikes as unexplainable things occur to them. Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video. “A woman claiming to be Dinda's biological mother, Karmila, comes to Aunt Donna's house and asks Dinda to visit her at her house in the forest. Wanting to spend time with her mother, Dinda goes ahead with the visit without Aunt Donna's agreement. This leads to her getting trapped inside the house in the middle of the forest, along with her siblings and friends. There, strange things begin to happen. Things turn worse when Dinda, who previously escaped an encounter with a female vampire ghost known as the Kuntilanak, finds herself once again facing the ghost, only it's different from the one she defeated with spikes and spells before.” This horror movie is divided into three chapters. The first chapter “Wicked” takes place during the reign of King Rama VI. It tells of a village deep within a forest where unexplainable events occur due to a curse. “Tattoo”, the second chapter is about a cruel curse that is embroidered through ink into the victim's skin, forcing them to carry the curse until they die.

The film is about a couple who just lost their baby due to complications during childbirth, and they move to a new house to start fresh. Little do they know, the house carries a dark secret and their journey of hardships have only just begun.” Speaking about the film, local filmmaker Sein Qudsi, said, “I never thought I would venture into another horror film after I did 'Bangunan' in 2015. I consider myself more of an action drama/thriller film lover, but 'Till Death: Azalea's Wrath' has a strong relatable story at its heart. Apart from the horror genre, the main theme of this film is family and support. Losing a child is a great loss and affects a family in many ways – especially the mother. We explore these themes in the film, with elements of suspense, horror and vengeance”.

Wow. In '10, #Texans LB Brian Cushing was suspended 4 gms for PEDs. The 10-game hit is for his 2nd. A 3rd suspension would be for at least 2 yrs Cushing's suspension leaves an opening for rookie second round pick Zach Cunningham to assert himself as the future of the Texans' defense alongside Benardrick McKinney. Cunningham, like McKinney and Cushing, excels at shutting down the run between the tackles; unlike his teammates, Cunningham has excellent fluidity and short area quickness in coverage. It is possible that despite losing one of the leaders of this team, Houston's defense might actually be upgraded because of Cushing's suspension. Silver linings, I guess...

Such legislation originates as an Act of Congress passed by the United States Congress; such acts were either signed into law by the President or passed by Congress after a presidential veto. However, legislation is not the only source of regulations. There is also judge-made common law and constitutional law. The President can issue executive orders pursuant to a grant of discretion from Congress, or under the inherent powers that office holds to deal with certain matters which have the force of law. Many early executive orders were not recorded.  The State Department began numbering executive orders in the early 20th century, starting retroactively from President Abraham Lincoln's Executive Order Establishing a Provisional Court in Louisiana issued in 1862.

https://www.businessinsider.com/huge-racial-gap-in-life-expectancy-2014-1,This Chart Showing The Gap Between Black And White Life Expectancy Should Be A National Embarrassment,"The latest analysis by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) show that for people in the US, the average life expectancy in 2009 was 79 years — that's up from 68 in 1950 and 57 in 1929. But this generally positive upward trend obscures a yawning racial gap. Take a look at this chart: In 2009, the average life expectancy of black men and women in the United States was just 75. That's roughly the same as the average life expectancy of white men and women in 1979 — 30 years earlier. The average life expectancy of black men in 2009 was just 71 (compared to 76 for white men). While such a significant gap is troubling, the 2009 black/white life expectancy gap was actually at an all-time low of 4 years. In 1950, that gap was almost twice as large. It gets worse The CDC report looked only at race, Hispanic origin, and sex, but a 2012 Health Affairs study added level of education to the mix, demonstrating that the 4-year white/black life expectancy gap may hide just how different life can be in what the researchers call ""two Americas."" Black Americans may be worse off than white Americans, but Black Americans who have not completed high school lag even further behind. The researchers found that white men with 16 or more years of schooling can expect to live an average of 14 years longer than black men with fewer than 12 years of education.(For white and black women with the same educational differences, that gap was 10 years.) The stark differences the researchers uncovered are troubling, but the findings also suggest that — while access to healthcare and other factors are at play — improving educational opportunities may be a key part of making health disparities a thing of the past. While the racial gap has mostly been on the decline, the CDC explains that the widening gap between 1983 and 1993 (which is clear on the chart above) was likely due to ""increases in mortality among the black male population due to HIV infection and homicide"" at that time. What is killing black Americans? In a 2013 report, the CDC investigated persistent causes for the racial gap in life expectancy in more detail. ""Higher death rates due to heart disease, cancer, homicide, diabetes, and perinatal conditions"" accounted for 60 percent of the gap, the report noted. The report goes on to say that the gap would have been even larger ""if not for the lower death rates for the black population for suicide, unintentional injuries, and chronic lower respiratory diseases."" Below you can see what is disproportionately killing blacks (the dark blue bars) and where their death rates are actually lower than those of whites (the green bars). The gap exists because the higher death rates due to certain causes still outweigh any advantages. ""Death rates for the black population [are] higher than those for the white population for 8 of the 15 leading causes of death,"" the CDC has reported. Black people in the US are likelier to die from heart disease, for example, and white people are more than twice as likely to die from suicide than black people — but heart disease is the number one killer in the US, and suicide is number 10. Parts of the Affordable Care Act are designed to address health disparities, and the life expectancy gap is narrowing. But we need to do better – we need to erase it.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-income_counties_in_the_United_States,Highest-income counties in the United States,"There are 3,144 counties and county-equivalents in the United States.

https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/thq-nordic-buys-kingdom-come-deliverance-studio,THQ Nordic Buys Kingdom Come: Deliverance Studio,"THQ Nordic has bought yet another studio, this time it's Kingdom Come: Deliverance's Warhorse Studios. Announced by THQ Nordic and THQ Nordic AB subsidiary Koch Media, THQ Nordic has acquired the Prague-based Warhorse Studios on the one-year anniversary of Kingdom Come: Deliverance's release. Along with the acquisition, it was revealed that Kingdom Come: Deliverance sold over 2 million copies across PC, PS4 and Xbox One. The acquisition includes the development studio and all intellectual property rights of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, which is Warhorse's sole release since it was established in 2011. Koch Media and Warhorse already have an established relationship, as Koch Media's game publishing division Deep Silver helped publish Kingdom Come: Deliverance. According to GamesIndustry.biz, the studio was acquired in a €33.2 million ($37.4 million) cash deal. “Becoming part of THQ Nordic family is an important milestone for our studio,” said Warhorse Studios CEO Martin Fryvaldsky. ""We began as a small start-up with a handful of employees who were enthusiastic enough to join this challenging project. The skills of our team members, trust and support of our main investor and passion of our fans, who supported development of Kingdom Come: Deliverance through a Kickstarter campaign, helped us grow to an international level. We believe that backing by THQ Nordic and Koch Media will give us an extra push in our mission to bring exciting games to our customers and extend the frontiers of the gaming industry."" “We are delighted to welcome the team from Warhorse Studios in the Family,” said Koch Media GmbH CEO Dr. Klemens Kundratitz. ""The successful cooperation we developed during our journey with Kingdom Come: Deliverance linked both our companies already very closely and I am sure that our now even closer combined knowledge and experience will open up amazing new opportunities for both companies. Not only the 2 Million sold copies but also the motivation within the teams to create new ideas combined with the learnings from the past, are a rock solid foundation for future projects to build on."" For more on Kingdom Come: Deliverance, check out how its player base on Steam dropped off shortly after a solid launch. In our review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, we called the game “Great” saying it's ""an RPG that does the medieval era right with a refreshingly small-scale story and strong realistic combat."" THQ Nordic has infamously been buying studios, publishers and properties left and right, including Koch Media around this time last year, the Alone in the Dark and Act of War IP, and Carmagedddon. Prior to this latest acquisition, it reportedly had 35 unannounced games in development.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_video_games,Final Fantasy video games,"Final Fantasy is a video game series developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square). The first title in the series, the eponymous Final Fantasy, premiered in Japan in 1987, and Final Fantasy games have been released almost every single year since. Fifteen games have been released as part of the main (numbered) series. Sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and related video games have been published, as well as numerous titles in other media forms. Each game in the main series takes place in a different fictional universe rather than serve as direct sequels to prior games, although some titles have received sequels, or prequels, set in the same universe. Most of the games have been re-released for several different platforms, many of which have been included in bundled releases. The series as a whole is primarily composed of role-playing video games, but also includes massively multiplayer online role-playing games, third-person shooters, tower defense games, and tactical role-playing games. Final Fantasy games have been released on over a dozen video game consoles beginning with the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as for personal computers and mobile phones. The series is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 100 million units worldwide as of June 2011, across both the main series and its spin-offs. Final Fantasy's popularity has placed it as one of the best-selling video game franchises. Main series Main series-related games Final Fantasy Tactics Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy Final Fantasy XV Universe Spin-offs Note that three games were marketed in North America as The Final Fantasy Legend series, but they were originally created as entries in the SaGa series of games, and are not true Final Fantasy titles. None of the three games bore any Final Fantasy branding in their original Japanese versions. The games of the SaGa series include no themes or characters from the Final Fantasy games, therefore they are excluded from this list.

https://www.newidea.com.au/australian-prison-conditions-what-are-australian-jails-like,Australian Prison System,"Imprisonment in Australia is one of the possible punishments that people convicted in criminal trials can expect to receive. Only criminal convictions can result in a prison sentence; civil judgements typically only result in monetary restitution. In June 2018, just under 43,000 people were held in Australia's prisons, a four percent increase compared to the previous year. All Australian prisons are state prisons as there is no federal prison system in place, and about 18% of prisons are run privately. The terms 'prison' and 'jail' are often used interchangeably for any kind of incarceration, but in legal terms, they actually refer to two very different institutions. A jail is a temporary holding cell that is operated at the local government or county level. They're usually designed to hold suspects who are awaiting sentencing. Prisons, on the other hand, are larger facilities operated at the state level and are designed to hold convicted criminals for the duration of their sentences. The concept of an Australian jail doesn't exist, per se. Instead, incarceration is divided between prisons, correctional centres, and rehabilitation facilities. A 'correctional facility' is the general term for facilities at which convicts serve their sentences. It can encompass everything ranging from non-prison community service centres to supermax prisons that play host to the most dangerous criminals. Prisons are a subset of correctional facilities. They exclusively imprison inmates and don't feature any community service components. Examples of regular prisons include: Brisbane Correctional Centre, Ravenhall Correctional Centre, Yatala Prison, Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, Silverwater Correctional Complex, and Bathurst Correctional Centre. Maximum security prisons are prisons that have a vastly higher grade of security than standard prisons. They usually host long-term sentences and will often feature degrees of solitary confinement, limited freedom, and harsher living conditions. Examples of maximum security prisons include: Melbourne Remand Centre, Casuarina Perth Prison, and Goulburn Prison. These aren't the only types of prisons in Australia. Some special prisons are designed to receive prisoners and orient them into the system. An example of this prison is the: The HM Assessment Melbourne Prison. There are also heritage prisons that are listed as having cultural significance. An example of this would the late-Victorian prison, the Long Bay Correctional Centre. Long Bay jail's famous inmates include legendary escape artist and robber Darcy Dugan, and Rodney Adler, fraudster and former director of HIH Insurance. On paper, daily life in prison is pretty boring. Everything in your cell must be approved by the prison administration, from books and educational things to CD players. You're not allowed to have a phone, and in many prisons, you're not allowed to smoke. You can get visitors, but you're only allowed a certain number every week and they have to be preapproved by the prison. Of course. Australian prison conditions can sometimes be a lot worse. As much as 50% of all Australian prisoners are disabled in one way or another, whether that's physically or mentally. In many cases, these people are manipulated and abused. Some are even put into solitary confinement for weeks at a time – perhaps for their own safety, but it's still a terrible fate. Prisoners are also often required to perform labour, which can pay as little as $0.82 an hour. Large companies often hire out the low-cost services of prisoners. One notable example is Qantas, who partnered up with NSW prisons to have inmates pack their headsets and amenity packages Life in a supermax prison in Australia can be very hard, and nowhere is this more evident than at Goulburn Prison, sometimes referred to as Australia's toughest prison. Goulburn Prison is already a maximum security prison and has a special supermax wing for the most dangerous criminals. In this wing, prisoners spend 16 hours a day in their cells. They change cells as often as once a month and are x-rayed after every visit to check for contraband. They can't talk in non-English languages, and every communication they have, whether it's mail or visitors, is monitored. Several reports have come out that some Australian jail food is malnourishing or insufficient. Convicts and even people awaiting sentences are faced with soggy sandwiches, cold meals, and tiny portions. Bad prison food in Australia isn't a new thing. Back in the 1970s, there were several riots in Bathurst Correctional Centre, which was then known as Bathurst Gaol. Part of the reason? The sausages were smelly...and green Some prisons are designed specifically to hold female inmates, such as Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, Emu Plains Correctional Centre, and Dillwynia Correctional Centre. There are far fewer of these than the male-only prisons – unsurprising, given that there are only about 2,600 women in prison in Australia. Why have a separate women's facility? Well, aside from reducing the risk of sexual abuse in mixing male and female prisoners, female inmates are also observed to behave differently when compared to their male counterparts. First off, they're far less likely to riot or start violent scuffles, which reduces the need for security. Second, some prisons actually allow women to live with their children, or at the very least spend the holidays with them. Emu Plains is one of them, and its Mothers and Children's Program allows children of up to twelve years old to live with their mothers at a nursery known as Jacaranda Cottages. That said, while women's prisons may be run somewhat differently, they're still subject to the same visitation rules, labour requirements, and the security measures. Life in Australian prison is hard, there's no doubt. And mysteriously, even as crime rates go down, incarceration rates are going up. Sometimes, it's important to be reminded of the dismal life that awaits you if you commit crimes. But it's also important to be reminded of the fact that prisoners are still human, and rehabilitation and reformation are still possible goals for these people behind bars.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banned_video_games_in_Australia,Banned video games in Australia,"Below is a list and summary of video games that have been Refused Classification (banned) within Australia. Overview Originally, video games in Australia could only be rated up to MA15+. At the time, the R18+ classification rating could be given to film, but a video game with content deemed fitting for the R18+ rating would be 'Refused Classification' due to an appropriate classification not being available for the medium. In July and August 2011, all Australian state Attorneys-General agreed to instate an R18+ rating for video games, which would be available by the end of 2011. Many games previously refused classification would now fit into the R18+ rating and, if the publisher chose to pay the reclassification fee, would theoretically be able to sell their game in Australia. The date was later changed to allow the rating to be introduced at the beginning of 2013. With the R18+ rating in place, it is expected fewer video games will be Refused Classification. Games may still be Refused Classification if deemed to contain material unsuitable for R18+ classification, such as depictions of sexual violence or the promotion of illegal drug use, as well as drug use that is related to incentives and rewards. More specifically, games which may be Refused Classification include: Detailed instruction or promotion in matters of crime or violence. Depiction of rape. The promotion or provision of instruction in pedophile activity. Descriptions or depictions of child sexual abuse or any other exploitative or offensive descriptions or depictions involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 years. Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of: (i) violence with a very high degree of impact or which are excessively frequent, prolonged or detailed; (ii) cruelty or real violence which are very detailed or which have an extremely high impact; (iii) sexual violence Depictions of practices such as bestiality Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of: (i) activity accompanied by fetishes or practices that are offensive or abhorrent; (ii) incest fantasies or other fantasies that are offensive or abhorrent Classification is compulsory, and games refused classification by the ACB are banned for sale, hire or public exhibition, carrying a maximum fine of $275,000 and/or 10 years' jail. It is, however, legal to possess RC games (except in Western Australia and prescribed areas of the Northern Territory). Material that is refused classification is put on the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service list of prohibited items. Any copies of such games found at the border will be seized, and the recipient, depending on the number of copies being imported, may receive up to A$110,000 in fines. The list depicted below is of games that are either still banned, or were initially banned but have been edited exclusively for Australia. Some of these games were banned before the introduction of the R18+ category; if some of these games were to be re-rated today, they would likely receive the R18+ rating. The second list is of games that have been eventually released unedited, rating appealed or the worldwide edition later being released uncut and being identical to other countries. Due to the licensing of the International Age Rating Coalition software for developers to rate their own game, several hundred games have been banned from various app stores and due to said games being relatively minor they will not be listed here. List of video games refused classification Current The list below includes games where the worldwide edition has been banned for sale in Australia because either the game has been refused classification or a classification has been revoked. Games in this list with a current classification are available for purchase in a censored or altered form. Overturned The list below includes games where the Australian edition is identical to that of other countries because either: the rating has successfully been appealed, the worldwide edition has later been released in Australia unedited (""uncut""), or the game has received a worldwide edit.",,0.804591,"[['Name','Original Date of Certification','Reason']['50 Cent: Bulletproof (2005)','2005-10-25','Banned because of high impact bloody violence.

The data are compiled by Nielsen Soundscan based on each album's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as on-demand streaming and digital sales of its individual tracks. In 2017, a total of 38 albums claimed the top position of the chart. Beginning with vocal group Pentatonix's Christmas album, A Pentatonix Christmas, issue dated January 7, another one of which, Canadian singer The Weeknd's third studio album, Starboy returned to the top slot a week later after three weeks from the slot, issue dated December 17, 2016. Taylor Swift's Reputation was the best selling album of 2017. Singer Ed Sheeran's ÷ is the second best-selling album with 451,000 album-equivalent units, of which 322,000 were pure album sales. Rapper Kendrick Lamar's fourth studio album, Damn, went on to become the third best-seller with 603,000 album-equivalent units in its first week of release (353,000 in pure album sales). In the meantime, another Canadian artist Drake's ""playlist"", More Life, which broke many streaming records, sustained 505,000 album-equivalent units, of which 226,000 were pure sales.

https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/5-best-ufc-fighters-from-brazil,The 5 best UFC fighters from Brazil,"Although the UFC began in Colorado, USA, it wouldn't be unfair to call Brazil the true birthplace of MMA. After all, it was in the heart of Brazil where the earliest mixed martial arts fights – in the form of no-holds-barred Vale Tudo – took place, and of course, it was the country that brought Gracie Jiu-Jitsu to the world and enabled the style to rule over the earliest UFC events. It's no surprise that over the near-25 year history of the UFC, some of the promotion's greatest champions and fighters have hailed from Brazil. The list is only growing, too, partly helped by the foothold that the UFC now has in the country, as they put on numerous events there each year. It'll take a lot from any young Brazilian fighter to gain a slot on the pantheon of legends, though – here are the top five Brazilian fighters in UFC history, along with a handful of honourable mentions. Honourable Mentions: Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira – In the pantheon of Brazilian MMA legends, 'Minotauro' would almost certainly sit somewhere right near the top. In his prime, he was the greatest Heavyweight in the sport and an argument could still be made for him belonging in a top five of all time in his division. But despite winning the Interim Heavyweight title in the UFC, his greatest successes – wins over Mark Coleman, Heath Herring, Mirko Cro Cop et al – came in PRIDE, as did his greatest championship run. He did well in the UFC, but he'd probably admit himself that he was past his best when he arrived there. Murilo Bustamante – One of the founding members of the legendary Brazilian Top Team, Bustamante was a fighter somewhat before his time in that he blended excellent boxing and wrestling in with his world-class jiu-jitsu. He parlayed those skills into a run as UFC Middleweight champion in the early Zuffa-run days but left the company after just one title defence following a contract dispute. If he'd stuck around then who knows, he could well have made the top five – he certainly had the skills. Junior Dos Santos – One of the Nogueira brothers' many protégés, Dos Santos came into the UFC looking unstoppable – he took out his first eight opponents to win the UFC Heavyweight title from Cain Velasquez – a man considered unbeatable at the time. A successful defence followed, but then Velasquez regained his title in a rematch and then defeated JDS in a rubber match to cement his status as the top dog. Dos Santos was never the same after the Velasquez fights, but the blistering beginning to his UFC career gives him a spot here. Lyoto Machida – Machida brought a completely unique game into the UFC with his karate-based style, and for a while it was perfect for him – he defeated six opponents and then dethroned Rashad Evans to win the UFC Light-Heavyweight title, and carrying an unbeaten record, it looked like he'd be a tricky man to topple. Less than a year after his reign began, though, he was beaten by 'Shogun' Rua and then never really got back to the top. Still, his incredible list of victims – Tito Ortiz, Evans, Randy Couture, Ryan Bader and Dan Henderson amongst them – as well as his unique style means he goes down as a true Brazilian legend.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_events,UFC events,"This is a list of events held and scheduled by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a mixed martial arts promotion based in the United States. UFC's first event, UFC 1, took place on November 12, 1993. Each UFC event contains several fights. Traditionally, every event starts off with a preliminary card followed by a main card, with the last fight being known as the main event. Overview UFC events are separated into seven different formats: ""Numbered"" events, currently airing on pay-per-view, with some exceptions ""UFC on ESPN"" events, currently airing on ESPN ""UFC on Fox"" events, formerly aired on Fox ""Fight Night"" events, formerly aired on Spike, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 or UFC Fight Pass. Currently airing on ESPN+ ""The Ultimate Fighter Finale"" events, formerly aired on Spike, FX, Fox Sports 1 or UFC Fight Pass. Will begin on ESPN+ in 2020 ""UFC on FX"" events, formerly aired on FX ""UFC on Fuel TV"" events, formerly aired on Fuel TV ""UFC Live"" events, formerly aired on Versus Most of the ""numbered"" events have taken place on pay-per-view, though there have been a few exceptions for reasons such as tape-delay. Events such as UFC 72, which took place in Belfast, Northern Ireland, U.K., were sold on pay-per-view, but due to tape-delay, purchase rates were not as high as events that aired at a traditional starting time. As such, events taking part in significantly different time zones, including UFC 70, UFC 75, UFC 89, UFC 95, UFC 105, UFC 120, UFC 122, and UFC 138, were given a same-night airing in American prime time on Spike. Historically, the UFC has also aired preliminary fights prior to the main fight cards, either on television via Spike, FX, and Fuel TV, or online via Facebook and YouTube. Beginning in August 2013, starting with UFC Fight Night: Shogun vs. Sonnen, the UFC began airing non-PPV events on either Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2. In January 2014, as part of the organization's global expansion, the UFC began airing various international events exclusively on their subscription-based digital network, UFC Fight Pass. In July 2009, the UFC held its unofficial 100th ""numbered event""; however, officially, despite being called UFC 100, it was actually the 101st numbered event (not to mention the 133rd event overall). The UFC signed a deal with Fox Sports Net, after Fox agreed to broadcast one fight in June 2002, during its ""All-Star Summer"" that month. UFC 37 and 38 had already been scheduled and promoted, but as UFC 38 was the promotion's debut in the United Kingdom, they created UFC 37.5; an event that became the first ever mixed martial arts fight available on cable television. As of UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. The Korean Zombie, which took place on December 21, 2019, there have been 505 UFC events held in 158 cities in 28 countries. Other events In May 2017, the UFC announced White would hold Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series weekly on UFC Fight Pass (becoming, from January 2019 on, an exclusive content on ESPN+ in the United States). As with the earlier web series Looking for a Fight, the goal of the series is for White to scout talent for the UFC. It was stated ahead of the license being approved that “this is not the UFC, this is not the UFC brand,” but instead a promotion that will allow up and coming fighters the chance to showcase their talents in hopes that one day they may compete in the UFC.

But how many people have died taking part in the race, and what happened to Matt Campbell, the MasterChef star who tragically passed away last year? Since the inaugural race in 1981, 11 runners have died, The Guardian reported – which makes Matt Campbell the 12th contestant to pass away. Seven cardiac deaths occurred between 1991 and 2003, according to Peak Performance. In 2000, a man collapsed on the finishing line complaining of neck pain and died the following day in hospital of a brain haemorrhage. A study by the American College of Cardiology in 2009, found that the risk of death from running a marathon is 0.8 per 100,000 people. This is significantly lower than dying from childbirth in the UK which in 2012 was 8.6 in 100,000 births, reports the Telegraph. Here are some notable deaths from recent years at the London Marathon. 2007: David Rogers, aged 22, died from hyponatremia (caused by low sodium in the blood) 2012: Claire Squires, aged 30, died from a heart attack after taking energy boosting supplement DMAA 2014: Robert Berry, aged 42, died from heat stroke 2016: David Seath, aged 31, died from a heart attack 2018: Matt Campbell, aged 29, died after collapsing during the race Matt Campbell, 29, a professional chef from the Lake District, died after collapsing during this year's race. He received immediate medical treatment on the scene from race doctors but died later in hospital. The young chef had posted an excited picture of his race kit and another of him and a friend ahead of running. He posted on the MasterChef UK Facebook page the day before the marathon: ""Myself and Tom Peters after meeting in the final 12 of MasterChef have decided to run London Marathon together, I'm running for @brathayevents and Tom is running for @asthmauk. ""We are nervous but feeling fit and ready! Gonna be as hot as the MasterChef kitchen was last year it looks like."" Temperatures during the 2018 race peaked at 23.2C, making the race the hottest ever. The highest temperature previously recorded on marathon day was 21.7C at midday on the race in 2007. More than 40,000 people took their place on the starting line in central London and organisers said they put plans in place should runners fall victim to the heat. Virgin Money London Marathon event director Hugh Brashner said before the event: ""We have a number of contingency plans in place in case of hot weather and we will be sending advice to runners and spectators later in the week.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate,Causes of death by rate,"The following is a list of the causes of human deaths worldwide for the year 2002, arranged by their associated mortality rates. There were 57,029,000 deaths tabulated for that year. Some causes listed include deaths also included in more specific subordinate causes (as indicated by the ""Group"" column), and some causes are omitted, so the percentages do not sum to 100. According to the World Health Organization, about 58 million people died in 2005, using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 52.77 million people died in 2010. The causes listed are relatively immediate medical causes, but the ultimate cause of death might be described differently.  For example, tobacco smoking can cause lung disease or cancer, and alcohol abuse can cause liver failure or a motor vehicle accident.  For statistics on preventable ultimate causes see Preventable causes of death. By frequency The table below uses data from 2002 and is out of date. Data is now available for 2015. Note: Tinted backgrounds indicate items that also appear in the subsequent table.  Percentage figures add to more than 100% because some deaths appear in both broadly-defined and narrowly defined categories; for example, Cardiovascular Deaths includes deaths from both Ischaemic Heart Disease and Stroke. Malnutrition Malnutrition can be identified as an underlying cause for shortened life. 70% of childhood deaths (age 0-4) are reportedly due to diarrheal illness, acute respiratory infection, malaria and immunizable disease. However 56% of these childhood deaths can be attributed to the effects of malnutrition as an underlying cause. The effects of malnutrition include increased susceptibility to infection, musculature wasting, skeletal deformities and neurologic development delays. According to the World Health Organization, malnutrition is named as the biggest contributor to child mortality with 36 million deaths in 2005 related to malnutrition. Developed vs. developing economies Top causes of death, according to the World Health Organization report for the calendar year 2001: By age group By occupation With an average of 123.6 deaths per

https://india.mongabay.com/2018/08/india-develops-real-time-tsunami-prediction-system,India develops 'real time' tsunami prediction system,"In 2004, India suffered from one of the most devastating natural disasters when a tsunami struck the Indian coast. It led to over 10,000 deaths and several thousand people went missing. It resulted in extensive damage to property and crops as well. Subsequently, India had set up a tsunami early warning centre to predict any such event in the future and prepare the administration. Over the years, India's centre has become one of the most modern tsunami warning centres of the world. Now, in a major update to the already advanced system, INCOIS has developed a mechanism to predict the extent of danger and damage in real time, once a tsunami occurs. In a major development in India's capability to assess dangers following a tsunami event, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has now developed a system which will be able to predict risk to coastal areas, height of waves that can hit them and even pinpoint vulnerable buildings, all in 'realtime'. This will make India the first nation in the world to do so, said INCOIS, an institute under the Indian government's Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). “In the current scenario of tsunami forecast, India uses the earthquake information (location and magnitude) to provide coastal forecast of expected tsunami arrival times and expected wave amplitudes at beach along with threat status (warning/alert/watch/no threat) using tsunami scenario database,” said E. Pattabhi Rama Rao, a scientist at INCOIS, while explaining the new system to the Mongabay-India. Pattabhi Rama Rao, the head of INCOIS's Tsunami and Storm Surge Early Warning Services Group (TWG), said that the “capability of being able to run the propagation and inundation model in real-time will be beneficial to operational tsunami warning centres to reduce the uncertainties in tsunami forecasting.” This would mean a major update to the present mechanism. “If we run a model in real-time, we need not depend on scenario databases that are run using worst-case parameters. Instead, we can wait for real-time earthquake source parameters that can be derived within 15-20 minutes of the earthquake and use those for running the model in real-time. Those forecasts will be much more accurate than scenario-based forecasting (used at present),” Pattabhi added. The model is being run on experimental mode and will be operationalised in the near future. The government has identified a list of regions on the country's eastern coast that are highly vulnerable to a tsunami. These include Puri, Kakinada, Machilipatnam, Nizampatnam-Vatapalem, Chennai, Cuddalore-Puducherry, Rameshwaram, Thoothukudi, Alappuzha-Chavara and Kochi. “We have carried out a GIS mapping of these areas to the smallest possible detail (street and building level) including the socio-economic data. With this new model, in case of a tsunami event, we will be able to tell the areas are going to get hit, what time they will get hit and height of waves. The simulations will give a clear idea that which are the areas that can get inundated, the extent of inundation and up to which depth. It will even tell what kind of buildings that are vulnerable in these regions,” he added. With this capability, India will be the first country that will be able to provide tsunami inundation warnings in real time. The system was developed over the past three-four years. Tsunamis are generated by earthquakes of a magnitude of more than 8.5 in the oceans. One such tsunami in the Indian Ocean in December 2004, led to massive destruction along the coastline of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar islands of India. It resulted in 10,749 deaths, 5,640 persons went missing, 2.79 million people got affected, 11,827 hectares of crops were damaged and about 300,000 fisherfolk lost their livelihood. At that time, India's apparatus to detect any such event or its extent was found lacking. Caught unawares, the Indian government had subsequently set up the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC) at INCOIS to provide early warnings to the entire Indian Ocean region, in case of an impending tsunami event.. Since then, Indian scientists have made rapid strides to achieve better and accurate prediction capabilities. In fact, the Indian centre is now considered as one of the most modern tsunami warning centres of the world providing information to India as well as several other countries in the region. It was also designated as one of the Tsunami Service Providers (TSP) for the entire Indian Ocean region by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO in October 2011. Since then, it has been providing tsunami advisories and related services to all countries in the Indian Ocean Rim (25 Countries). Pattabhi stressed that with the new system, INCOIS will be able to give a realistic prediction – not overestimation or underestimation. However, the system is yet to cover all the major areas. For instance, the new update will not cover the region of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a group of 572 islands in the east of the Indian mainland in the Bay of Bengal. “It will be added into the system in the future,” said Pattabhi. Meanwhile, besides the new modelling system, INCOIS has been regularly organising mock drills and tests to check the preparedness of the entire chain of administration and find lacunae. One such mock drill was conducted last year in five coastal states on the eastern coast where mass evacuations were conducted in several areas. The exercise was then analysed in detail and it was found that email was the most effective form of communication as many a time SMS does not reach. The mock drills also ascertained that in which states officials were quickest to reach on the ground in case of an alert. A similar mock drill is now being planned in the first week of September of this year to review the preparedness during which there will be a mass evacuation of people living in vulnerable areas near the coast soon after the alarm is sounded. Several workshops have also been conducted by INCOIS at the national and international level. According to the MoES, the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System (ITEWS) comprises a real-time seismic monitoring network of 17 broadband seismic stations to detect tsunamigenic earthquakes. In addition to that, INCOIS receives data from around 90 national seismic stations that are established by various national local and regional centres. It also has a real-time sea-level network with seven tsunami buoys in the open ocean and 35 tide gauge stations at different coastal locations to monitor tsunamis and pre-run scenarios database of tsunami. The ITEWC is also receiving data from around 350 seismic stations, 50 tsunami buoys and 300 tide gauges of other international agencies in real time. “The centre is capable of detecting tsunamigenic earthquakes occurring in the Indian Ocean as well as in the global oceans within 10 minutes of their occurrence and disseminates the advisories to the concerned authorities,” said India's Minister for Earth Sciences Harsh Vardhan in reply to a query in the parliament on",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_finals,FIFA World Cup finals,"The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. The most recent World Cup, hosted by Russia in 2018, was won by France, who beat Croatia 4–2 in regulation time. The World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup. In the 21 tournaments held, 79 nations have appeared at least once. Of these, 13 have made it to the final match, and eight have won. With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World Cup finals tournament. Italy and Germany have four titles. Current champion France, along with past champions Uruguay and Argentina, have two titles each, while England and Spain have one each. The team that wins the finals receive the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and their name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy. The 1970 and 1994, along with the 1986, 1990 and 2014 games are to date the only matches competed by the same teams (Brazil–Italy and Argentina–Germany respectively). As of 2018, the 1934 final remains the latest final to have been between two teams playing their first final. The final match of the most recent tournament in Russia took place at the country's biggest sports complex, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. The 1930 and the 1966 games are the only ones that did not take place on a Sunday. The former did on a Wednesday and the latter on a Saturday. As of 2018, only nations from Europe and South America have competed in a World Cup final. Six nations have won the final as host: Uruguay, Italy, England, Germany, Argentina and France.

https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/being-mary-jane-cancelled-bet-1202587478,'Being Mary Jane' to End in 2018 With Two-Hour Movie Special on BET,"Being Mary Jane” will end its run in 2018 with a two-hour finale movie, Variety has confirmed. The series starring Gabrielle Union has aired on the network for four seasons, with the fourth season concluding on Sept. 19. The show revolves around a successful broadcast journalist Mary Jane Paul (played by Union), and her professional and private life. The series originally launched as a movie on BET before being turned into a series. Season 4 of the series was executive produced by Will Packer and Erica Shelton Kodish, who also serves as the series showrunner and writer. Packer and Shelton Kodish join Union, series creator Mara Brock Akil and her husband Salim Akil as executive producers and co-executive producer Jeff Morrone. BET, Will Packer Productions and Akil Productions produced the fourth season of the series. Korin D. Huggins, head of television for Will Packer Productions, will oversee on behalf of Will Packer Productions. Akil served as showrunner for the show's first three seasons, but departed with Salim ahead of Season 4 for an overall deal with Warner Bros. “'Being Mary Jane' has been a landmark series not only for BET, but for African American women around the world who saw themselves in Mary Jane, her family, friends and coworkers. From the captivating storytelling, to the richly complex characters, to the powerful issues tackled on the series, we remain immensely proud,” said Connie Orlando, head of programming for BET Networks. “We are grateful to the cast and creators of Being Mary Jane, who have worked tirelessly to bring this world to vivid life over the past 4 seasons. We also thank the many loyal viewers whose hearts and minds were captured every week, and kept Mary Jane trending worldwide. We look forward to closing out Mary Jane's journey with a series finale that is sure to blow fans away!” BET, a Viacom-owned cable network, was one identified by the company's new CEO Bob Bakish as one of its core cable brands along with VH1, Comedy Central, Spike (soon to be re-branded as the Paramount Network), MTV, Nickelodeon, and Nick Jr. Being Mary Jane took me away from very long days and I got lost in her character, Ms. Gabriel is a brilliant actress and I truly wish the show would continue. I hate to see it go I felt like I was Mary Jane Paul lol I would like to know when the finale will air I will buy all the season and watch them all over again just like I did when Zane sex chronicles stop airing her show was and update to it a more modern age of it. I'm going to hate to see it end amazing show. where the hell is it!! its not on the programming schedule, its the 19th !!!!! so when will it air????????????????? Love this show, sad to see it end. When will the 2 hour finale air in Canada? When will the 2-hour finale of being made Jane air on TV Please make another season!!!! I love this show Wow they shouldn't cancel this show i love this show im hurting right now reading this Think about it if you end the show what will happen to the kids who not really suppose to watch but does it anyways. When I first saw this show I knew at that second that I wanted to a big time top news reported just like Mary Jane and If you take that away then what will I look up to Nothing because the show my all time idol shows in will be gone and what about other girls nd boys well because I'm only 14 and that show is the bomb and If you guys wanna take away the show then you might as well take away my dreams This was an excellent show! I'm so going to miss this show. Why does all the good ones have to end. Maybe I can do a spin off. Just a thought.. This show should continue on Netflix or Hulu since Bet did not pick it up. There are many viewers online that stream shows than watching them on Prime TV If BET were Black Owned, it WOULD NOT BE CANCELED!!! © Copyright 2020 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC.

https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/a27559974/emmerdale-louisa-clein-leaving-maya-stepney-role-jacob-grooming-storyline,Emmerdale star Louisa Clein set to leave role as evil Maya Stepney following grooming storyline,"Emmerdale star Louisa Clein is set to leave the ITV soap once her grooming storyline finishes up. Clein has been at the centre of Emmerdale's biggest storyline of the last year as evil teacher Maya Stepney, who has groomed her underage student Jacob Gallagher (Joe-Warren Plant). With the story entering a new phase following Maya's arrest earlier this week, The Sun reports that Clein has wrapped up her stint on the show and got a send-off from the rest of the cast last week. Digital Spy has subsequently learned that the nature of Clein's role was specific to this grooming storyline, and thus never intended to be a permanent fixture on Emmerdale beyond that plot. Because of the soap's filming schedule, Clein's character Maya could still be on screen for a while yet, considering she just finished filming last week. We have also reached out to Emmerdale for clarification on Louisa Clein's future on the soap. Maya is currently in custody, but Priya Sharma, Leyla Harding and Tracy Metcalfe's attempt to cover up their attack on her has put any investigation into her abuse at risk On Wednesday (May 22), Matthew Wolfenden — who plays David Metcalfe — hinted that there's much more to come in the grooming storyline because Jacob doesn't yet accept that he's been manipulated by Maya. ""I think it is going to be a long process, and we're going to show Jacob's struggle with that and David's struggle with that,"" he said on Loose Women. Clein has also spoken at length about the impact of bringing grooming to light on Emmerdale, revealing that she's received feedback from real-life abuse victims who feel ""this story's helping them"". ""I'm getting messages from victims. They thought that they were in a relationship with someone, they thought maybe that person was also seeing someone else,"" she shared on Loose Women last month. ""They were seeing a teacher, they were seeing a married man or woman, and they thought it was this loving, emotionally conducive relationship, and it was."" Prior to her stint in Emmerdale, Clein played Kim Whitfield in Holby City and was also a regular on the BBC legal drama Judge John Deed in the early-mid 2000s. Emmerdale currently airs weekdays at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/bernie-sanders-net-worth-14678955,What Is Bernie Sanders' Net Worth?,"The 2016 presidential campaign won't be leaving our memories anytime soon -- in fact, it is probably forever burned into them (whether we like it or not). But, despite coming in a proverbial ""third"" in the race for the presidency, Bernie Sanders has managed to stay in the headlines. Whether it be taking to Twitter to disapprove of CEOs or persistently supporting the democratic party, Sanders has managed to keep in the public eye. And with the supporter base and funding from small donors to stay in the 2020 race for some time, he doesn't look to leave the public eye anytime soon. But what is the political heavy-hitter (who has consistently espoused democratic-socialist policies) actually worth? And how did he accumulate his cash? According to Celebrity Net Worth, as of 2017, Sanders is worth an estimated $2 million. Compared to the current president (who boasts a net worth of an astounding $3.10 billion), it's a bit meager. Still, the ultra-famous proponent of democratic socialism has had a pretty long career, spanning several different occupations. So how did Sanders make his millions? According to reports, Sanders made $1 million in 2016 -- $795,000 of which allegedly came from a book advance. Although the politician's salary from the Senate is rather modest compared to his other career endeavors (allegedly around $174,000 in 2016), his other investments and holdings bring his net worth up to the $2 million mark for last year. But how did Sanders build his name? Hailing from Brooklyn, New York, Sanders was born to two Polish immigrants in the 1940s. But Sanders first hit the political scene as mayor of Burlington, Vermont in the early 1980s, where he served from 1981 to 1989 -- a total of four terms. After his time serving in Burlington, Sanders set his sights a little higher and aimed for House of Representatives -- which he was able to secure, taking a seat in the House in 1991. After serving in the House until 2007, Sanders was elected Senator of Vermont that year, and has held that position ever since. The senator also took on the role of Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 2013, passing legislation aimed at improving VA health care in 2014. Sanders also reportedly serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Committee on Budget, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. The senator has long been known for his outspoken views on the middle class, the wealthy top 1%, and war. Sanders has also long been a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, which he's defined for himself in the past. ""I think [democratic socialism] means the government has got to play a very important role in making sure that as a right of citizenship, all of our people have health care; that as a right, all of our kids -- regardless of income -- have quality childcare; are able to go to college without going deeply into debt; that it means we do not allow large corporations and moneyed interests to destroy our environment; that we create a government in which it is not dominated by big-money interest,"" Sanders has said. ""I mean, to me, it means democracy, frankly. That's all it means."" Sanders boasts the title of being the longest-serving independent in congressional history -- serving from 2007 on, winning the 2012 re-election by 71%. But Sanders had higher aspirations than the Senate, declaring in April of 2015 that he would be running for the Democratic Party during the 2016 presidential election. Sanders was something of a controversial democratic candidate in the 2016 election. As a self-professed democratic socialist, Sanders ruffled some conservative feathers with his comments about the wealthy, among other hot topics. In fact, Sanders wrote some controversial comments about the wealthy (calling them oligarchs) in an op-ed for CNN back in 2016. ""They want more, more and more -- no matter what impact their efforts have on working people, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor,"" Sanders wrote. ""Greed is their religion."" Still, Sanders championed many causes that a decent size of the voting populace -- over 2 million voters under 30 years old in caucuses and primaries, according to The Washington Post -- resonated with. The senator's platform rested on causes like LGBTQ rights, environmental protection, free college tuition, fairer taxes, sensible drug policies and more. Although Sanders was beat out as the primary Democratic candidate by Hillary Clinton (who, in turn, lost to Republican candidate Donald Trump), Sanders has continued fighting for these policies in his ongoing Senate term. Sanders's surprising 2016 campaign had staying power, and many of his policy proposals had become far more mainstream in discourse. As a result, when the 2020 Democratic primary was being discussed, Sanders was seen as a clear frontrunner. He had remained a public face and continued championing various causes, including a $15 minimum wage. In February of 2019, Sanders became one of many to announce that they would be running for President in the Democratic primary. Much of his 2016 platform - healthcare reform, environmental reform, free college tuition, etc. - remained integral parts of his 2020 campaign. On April 15th, 2019, Sanders released ten years of tax returns, confirming his status as a millionaire. Sanders attributed this to the success of his book, telling the New York Times, ""I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" The impassioned senator has had his share of controversies. During the 2016 campaign, a leaked email scandal within the Democratic National Convention (DNC) showing support for candidate Clinton over Sanders caused an uproar within the party itself. Nonetheless, according to NPR, support rallied around Sanders. The Brooklyn native has done his share of instigating controversy, as well, often through the new facilitator of such debates -- good old Twitter. Earlier this year, the 76-year-old went after Jeff Bezos, who was recently proclaimed the richest man in the world, for speculation over the multi-billionaire's wealth. The socialist-leaning senator claimed Bezos was part of a ""rigged economy."" Sanders didn't stop there -- he has (along with others like President Trump) repeatedly accused Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report of not paying taxes, according to an article on CNET. ""I remain deeply concerned about Amazon, an enormously profitable corporation, paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to depend on federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and public housing for survival,"" Sanders reportedly said. ""At a time of exploding profits, I would hope that Amazon would pay everyone who works in your fulfillment centers a living wage."" The senator even tweeted out on Amazon Prime day in support of workers who chose to go on strike. But apart from feuds with billionaires, Sanders has also received his own slack over several issues -- one being his debated appearance at the 2017 Women's Convention. Several attendees were disgruntled by the senator's male appearance on the stage. One was Lily Herman, who took to Refinery29 to express her displeasure. ""This event is literally called the 'Women's Convention,'"" Herman wrote for Refinery29. ""So it'd be nice to see, you know, women in the spotlight."" She also claimed that, ""Bernie Sanders headlining yet another major liberally-skewed event makes me say something I've mentioned a million times before: There are grave issues if your entire movement is centered around a single person."" Still, others were not upset by the appearance, claiming he embodied the ideals of the Women's Convention, according to Vox. Sanders has attracted a certain amount of criticism for some of his spending habits, as well -- whether fair or not -- given the senator's long-avowed aversion to the lavishly wealthy. While the senator has long been critical of the top 1%, Sanders allegedly dropped some $600,000 on a beach house in 2016 in Vermont's Lake Champlain Islands. Additionally, the senator attracted some controversy over several of his other purchases, including a jacket that prompted Newsweek to shoot out a headline stating ""Socialist Bernie Sanders wears a $700 jacket while complaining about rich people."" Still, compared to countless other fellow millionaires, like Tiger Woods and Ronaldo, Sanders' spending habits are meek, at best. Sanders and his wife Jane reportedly have a 30-year mortgage of $50,000-$100,000 for a condo in Washington, DC, according to Politico. And, in 2014, Sanders and his wife allegedly gave some $8,350 to charity, according to CBS. The 76-year-old seems to show no signs of slowing down. As a current senator, Sanders may be focused on the 2020 presidential nomination. But the senator has recently accumulated what Politico called a ""growing string of losses"" among fellow democrats in 2018 whom Sanders has backed or supported. Among others, the senator-approved candidates for mayor in Omaha and for House in Montana lost their races last year, with more of his picks losing in Kansas primaries and a Michigan governor race. In fact, Sanders' favorites' recent losses could call into question the strength of the platform on which the senator would run if he decided to chase the 2020 presidency, as some reports claim. Still, Sanders remains optimistic. Despite recent reports claiming Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden rank as the top picks for the 2020 election (Sanders allegedly has a 48% approval rating, according to Newsweek), recent polls may suggest otherwise. In fact, a July 2018 Rasmussen poll revealed that 73% of Democrats want a younger 2020 candidate for the presidency. This could mean bad news for Biden and Sanders, who are both upward of 75. During the presidential race in 2016, Sanders released his tax returns, which detailed what a Forbes writer deemed a ""boring"" report of the law-abiding senator's finances. However, some noted that Sanders' Social Security deductions bordered on hypocritical, given the senator's position on the wealthy paying Social Security taxes on all their income: He only paid taxes on 85% of them in 2016. Still, Sanders' taxes have seemed fairly normal and straightforward -- which surely is a good thing for Sanders, given his scrutiny of corporate and CEOs taxes in the past.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_income,U.S. states and territories by income,"This is a list of U.S. states, territories and the District of Columbia by income.

https://time.com/5395444/europe-far-right-italy-salvini-sweden-france-germany,These 5 Countries Show How the European Far-Right Is Growing in Power,"Across Europe, populism is growing on both the left and the right—but it has much more momentum on the right. In a sign of the political times, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker used his final State of the Union speech this week to denounce “unhealthy nationalism.” Here, five European countries witnessing the rise of the far-right: No far-right movement presents a bigger threat to Europe than Italy's anti-immigrant Lega. Some of that has to do with sheer size—Italy is the Eurozone's third-largest economy, which means that any type of political upheaval domestically has outsized impact on the rest of the European continent. Some of it also has to do with the fact that Lega and its leader, Matteo Salvini, thrive on direct confrontation with Brussels. Somewhere down the line, Lega will likely force new elections to capitalize on its recent popularity gains (as reward for its strong anti-migrant and anti-Brussels posturing, it's seen its support nearly double since March elections). For the time being, Salvini is actively building bridges with other far-right parties across Europe; he has a long-established relationship with the Front National/National Rally in France, and has made overtures to Eastern European politicians that align with his anti-immigration stance. And now that he's teamed up with Steve Bannon, Salvini is eager to translate his politics into a pan-European movement ahead of European Parliamentary elections next year. It used to be that nationalist parties in Europe wanted nothing to do with the EU; now they're aiming to take it over. “Changing Europe is a big goal,”Salvini told TIME in an interview this week. “But I think it is at our fingertips.” Once a pariah in Swedish politics given its past associations to neo-Nazis, the Sweden Democrats first entered parliament in 2010 but really broke through in 2014 when they took 13 percent of the vote. Long before immigration became the lightning-rod issue for Europeans it is today, the Sweden Democrats were hammering away at Sweden's relatively-open migration policy; they just had to wait for the rest of Europe's politics to catch up. In this past weekend's election, the Sweden Democrats took 17.6 percent of the vote. But it's important to put this in context. In the same election, Sweden's center-left and center-right political groupings took 40 percent of the vote… each. Indeed, two parties that actually advocated for better integration of immigrants, the Left Party and the Center Party, picked up more new seats in Parliament together (15) than the Sweden Democrats did alone (14). But neither the center-left nor center-right alliances have the seats to command a parliamentary majority outright. For the time being both sides have refused to work with the Sweden Democrats, but it remains to be seen whether they can continue to stand on principle as political realities begin to close in. The Alternativ fur Deutschland (AfD) party became the first far-right group to enter the Bundestag since World War II in September 2017, a direct response to Chancellor Angela Merkel's “open-door” policy to Syrian refugees. The AfD's taking of 94 parliamentary seats out of 709 threw the country's traditional political balances off-kilter; Merkel attempted to form a new coalition government with the Free Democrat liberals and the Greens, but was forced to return to her partnership with the flailing center-left Social Democrats after talks broke down. This “grand coalition” is by far the weakest government Merkel has ever helmed. Over the summer, the AfD even passed the Social Democrats in the polls. But for the time being, the AfD's real impact has less to do with their numbers in parliament than with the freedom it affords further-right elements within Merkel's own party ranks to push back against her. Just a few months ago, Merkel's coalition was facing an existential threat as the leader of the CSU (Merkel's CDU counterpart in Bavaria), Horst Seehofer, threatened to collapse the government unless Merkel acceded to stricter immigration controls along Germany's border. For the good of the country, Merkel ultimately relented… but made herself a lame duck in the process. Germany, whose economy continues to hum along, will be just fine with a weakened Merkel; the EU is another story. French President Emmanuel Macron saw the direction that the anti-establishment winds were blowing and created an upstart political party (Le Republique En Marche!) to counter Marine Le Pen and her Front National's far-right push with a technocratic, pro-European one of his own. But Macron's victory didn't spell the end of France's reactionary wing; far from it. While Le Pen failed to win the French presidency, she delivered a historic performance for France's far right in the first round of presidential elections, capturing 21.3 percent of the vote in a crowded field. One of the reasons she fared so poorly in the second round was a disastrous debate performance against Macron; despite that, her brand of nationalist, anti-immigration politics still took 33.9 percent of the vote (10.6 million absolute votes). Le Pen remains at the head of the party (rechristened “National Rally” in June), but the real person to keep an eye on is her niece, Marion Marechal-Le-Pen, who became an international political sensation in the runup to those 2017 elections. She has temporarily stepped away from politics, but is expected to return at some point and attempt to bridge the divide between National Rally voters and the more conservative elements of the traditional center-right Les Republicans. And she just might be able to pull it off: Macron's sudden rise has so effectively blurred the lines of French politics that no one knows who exactly is the “opposition.” If Marechal-Le Pen is able to convince voters that Macron is Establishment in everything but name and her movement is the real way to shake things up, France—and Europe—need to watch out. Then there are the the far-right leaders already in power. Following Juncker's speech, the European Parliament moved to back up his rhetoric with action, voting to begin censure proceedings against Hungary and its far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Orban has spent the last few years systematically undermining judicial independence in the country, targeting NGOs (particularly those backed by Hungarian-American liberal philanthropist George Soros) and stymying the country's free press. He also refuses outright to accept the EU's plan to redistribute asylum seekers across the political bloc. “The Hungarian people have decided that their country is not going to be a country of migrants,” he proclaimed to the European Parliament the day before the censure vote. It's precisely this type of defiance to Brussels bureaucracy that delivered Orban his latest electoral victory this past spring; it also gave his Fidesz party two-thirds of seats in Parliament, handing Orban the supermajority he needs to rewrite his country's constitution and further push the country toward the “illiberal democracy” he champions. And push it he will—suspending Hungary's voting rights and leveling sanctions against it requires unanimity from the EU's remaining members. Poland, which is lurching towards illiberalism itself, will likely veto any measures against Budapest, highlighting just how ill-equipped Europe is to punish member states that step out of line. That won't change anytime soon.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate,Countries by traffic-related death rate,"This list of countries by traffic-related death rate shows the annual number of road fatalities per capita per year, per number of motor vehicles, and per vehicle-km in some countries in the year the data was collected. According to the World Health Organization, road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.35 million deaths worldwide in the year 2016. That is, one person is killed every 25 seconds. Only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (seven percent of the world's population), have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drunk driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints). Over a third of road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income countries are among pedestrians and cyclists. However, less than 35 percent of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to protect these road users. The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100,000, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100,000. 74 percent of road traffic deaths occur in middle-income countries, which account for only 53 percent of the world's registered vehicles. In low-income countries it is even worse. Only one percent of the world's registered cars produce 16 percent of world's road traffic deaths. This indicates that these countries bear a disproportionately high burden of road traffic deaths relative to their level of motorization. There are large disparities in road traffic death rates between regions. The risk of dying as a result of a road traffic injury is highest in the African Region (26.6 per 100 000 population), and lowest in the European Region (9.3 per 100 000). Adults aged between 15 and 44 years account for 59 percent of global road traffic deaths. 77 percent of road deaths are males. The total fatalities figures comes from the WHO report (table A2, column point estimate, pp. 264–271) and are often an adjusted number of road traffic fatalities in order to reflect the different reporting and counting methods among the many countries (e.g., ""a death after how many days since accident event is still counted as a road fatality?"" (by international standard adjusted to a 30-day period), or ""to compensate for under-reporting in some countries"". List The table shows that the highest death tolls tend to be in African countries, and the lowest in European countries. The table first lists geographic regions before alphabetically sorted countries.",,0.77046,"[['Country','Continent','Road fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants per year','Road fatalities per 100,000

""The BCCI has a zero-tolerance policy for age fraud in sport and has taken strict action against cricketers found guilty of manipulating their date of birth certificates while registering for BCCI tournaments,"" said the BCCI in a statement. ""As conveyed to state associations at the start of the season, BCCI wishes to reiterate that from the 2018-19 season, any cricketer who is found guilty of tampering his/her date of birth will be disqualified and barred from participating in any BCCI tournament for a period of 2 years ie 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons,"" it added. Earlier, a cricketer faced a ban of one year. Latest Comment Good decision.Tanmoy K In September, the BCCI had banned a Meghalya-bound Delhi player, Jaskirat Singh Sachdeva, for producing a fake birth certificate to play in an Under-19 tournament. Age fraud is a perennial phenomenon facing junior cricket. In 2016, former India captain Rahul Dravid had acknowledged age-fudging as a major problem in Indian cricket and welcomed BCCI's decision to allow a player to compete in the U-19 World Cup only once.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_single-game_grand_slam_leaders,Major League Baseball single-game grand slam leaders,"In baseball, a grand slam is a home run that is hit when all three bases are loaded, thereby scoring four runs—the most possible in one play.  Thirteen players have hit two grand slams in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date, the most recent being Josh Willingham of the Washington Nationals on July 27, 2009. No player has accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever hit more than two in a game. Tony Lazzeri was the first player to hit two grand slams in a single game, doing so for the New York Yankees against the Philadelphia Athletics on May 24, 1936. Every team which had a player hit two grand slams won their milestone games.  These games have resulted in other single-game MLB records being set due to the extreme offensive performance. Lazzeri, for example, proceeded to hit a third home run in the game and finished with a total of eleven runs batted in, an American League record. Fernando Tatís became the only player to hit two grand slams in the same inning, when he attained the milestone, slugging two in the third inning for the St. Louis Cardinals on April 23, 1999.  In achieving the feat, he also set a new major league record with eight runs batted in in a single inning. Tony Cloninger is the only pitcher to have accomplished the feat. Bill Mueller hit his grand slams from both sides of the plate, while Jim Northrup hit his grand slams on consecutive pitches received in the fifth and sixth innings. Nomar Garciaparra is the sole player to achieve the feat at home, doing so at Fenway Park for the Boston Red Sox.  Cloninger is the only player who never hit a grand slam before or after his milestone game, while Robin Ventura—with 18 grand slams—hit more than any other player in this group. Frank Robinson is also a member of the 500 home run club. Of the nine players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have hit two grand slams in a game, two have been elected, one on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave ineligible one player—Josh Willingham— who is living and has played in the past five seasons and one—Jim Tabor—who did not play in 10 seasons.

https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8464342/drake-scorpion-debut-no1-billboard-200-chart-sets-streaming-record,"Drake Earns Eighth No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'Scorpion,' Sets New Streaming Record","Drake's Scorpion album makes a smashing, streaming-powered debut atop the Billboard 200 chart, as the set opens with the largest overall week of 2018 for any album. Scorpion, which was released on June 29 via Young Money/Cash Money/Republic Records, bows with 732,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending July 5 according to Nielsen Music. Of that sum, 160,000 were in traditional album sales. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the US based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units. Units are comprised of traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). As of this week, each unit equals one traditional album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from one album (a TEA unit), or 1,250 paid subscription on-demand audio song streams from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported on-demand audio song streams from an album (an SEA unit). (The weighting of an SEA unit was updated with the July 14-dated charts.) The new July 14-dated chart -- where Scorpion debuts at No. 1 -- will be posted in full on Billboard's websites on Tuesday, July 10. Here's a look at some of the feats and figures associated with Scorpion's arrival at No. 1: Drake's Eighth No. 1 Album: Scorpion is Drake's eighth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 -- the entirety of his full-length releases. His only charting album to miss the top slot was his debut EP, So Far Gone, which bowed and peaked at No. 6 in 2009. Drake ties Kanye West and Eminem for the second-most credited No. 1 albums among hip-hop acts in the history of the chart. Only JAY-Z is ahead of them, as he owns 14 chart-toppers. (Among all acts, The Beatles have the most No. 1s with 19.) Record-Tying Eight Straight No. 1s: Drake has earned all eight of his Billboard 200 No. 1s consecutively, tying West, Eminem and The Beatles for the longest streak of No. 1s. West had most recently joined the exclusive club when Ye bowed atop the June 16-dated chart . Biggest Streaming Week Ever for an Album: The 25-track Scorpion charges in with a new one-week record for on-demand audio streams generated by an album's songs: 745.92 million. It beats the previous record-holder, Post Malone's beerbongs & bentleys, when it arrived with 431.3 million on the May 12-dated chart. Post Malone now has the second-biggest streaming week. Drake now has four out of the 10 biggest streaming weeks for an album: Scorpion is No. 1, followed by 2017's More Life's debut frame (the No. 3 largest, with 384.84 million), More Life's second week (No. 6 with 253.49 million) and the opening week of 2016's Views (No. 7 with 245.09 million). First Album to Hit 1 Billion Streams for Its Songs Globally in a Single Week: Industry sources previously confirmed to Billboard that Scorpion is the first album to spur 1 billion on-demand audio streams, globally, for its songs in a single week. Largest Overall Week of 2018 for an Album: Scorpion's big bow of 732,000 equivalent album units is the biggest week for any album in 2018. It's also the largest since Taylor Swift's reputation, which started with 1.24 million units at No. 1 (Dec. 2, 2017-dated chart). The bulk of Scorpion's starting sum was driven by streams, as it garnered 551,000 SEA units. The remainder of its total unit sum was comprised of 21,000 TEA units and 160,000 in traditional album sales. Drake's last album, More Life, bowed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 505,000 equivalent album units total, of which 257,000 were SEA units, 23,000 were TEA units and 226,000 were traditional album sales. Biggest Week for an R&B/Hip-Hop Album in Over Two Years: Scorpion's start of 732,000 units is the largest week for an R&B/hip-hop album since Drake's own Views launched with 1.04 million units at No. 1 (on the May 21, 2016-dated chart). While Scorpion launches with over three times as many streams as Views tallied in its first week (745.9 million vs. 245.9 million), Views was able to earn a bigger overall unit number (1.04 million) because it had a much more robust bow in terms of traditional album sales. Views sold 851,000 albums in its first week, all from digital downloads. (The CD didn't go on sale until its second week of availability). Comparatively, Scorpion sold 160,000 copies, all via digital download. Scorpion will be issued on CD on July 13.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_chart_achievements_and_milestones,Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones,"This is a comprehensive listing that highlights significant achievements and milestones based upon Billboard magazine's singles charts, most notably the Billboard Hot 100.

All items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts). All-Time Hot 100 achievements (1958–2018) In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists. In 2013, Billboard revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition. In 2015, Billboard revised the rankings again. In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the Billboard chart's 60th anniversary. Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018. Also shown are the artists placing the most songs on the overall ""all-time"" top 100 song list.

From 1955 to 2001, under Billboard's previous methodologies, only two singles ascended directly to #1 from a previous position beneath the Top 20: The Beatles' ""Can't Buy Me Love"", which jumped from #27 to the top slot in April 1964, and Brandy and Monica's ""The Boy Is Mine"" which jumped from #23 to #1 in June 1998.

One exception was Jeannie C. Riley's ""Harper Valley PTA,"" which advanced 74 slots in August 1968; this upward acceleration went unmatched for 30 years, but has been surpassed over a dozen times since 2006.

When the songs originally charted in 1984, their chart positions in their final week on the Hot 100 were well below the top 10. Prior to 2008, the biggest drop off the Hot 100 was ""Nights in White Satin"" by The Moody Blues, which ranked at #17 in its final week on the chart in December 1972. This high drop-off position was matched in January 1975 by ""Junior's Farm"" by Paul McCartney and Wings. The record descent held for over three decades.  Each song above dropped off the Hot 100 upon four or fewer weeks; ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Junior's Farm"" dropped off after 18 and 12 weeks, respectively. Source: Seasonal songs During the holiday season, which includes Christmas, these songs regularly appear on the Hot 100, generally departing from the chart after the holiday season ends. In recent years, seasonal songs have reached into the top ten, and in 2019, for only the second time ever on the Hot 100 (the first since 1958), made it to number one. This has led to all-time records for dropping off the Hot 100, including from number one, as the songs depart the chart regardless of their final chart positions during the season.

Billboard now credits the dual #1 Presley single ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" as a single chart entity, and credits Presley with 17 number one singles. ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" spent 11 weeks at #1, ""Hound Dog"" for 6 weeks, ""Don't Be Cruel"" for 5 weeks. Many chart statisticians however, such as Joel Whitburn, still list Presley as having 18 number ones.  Source: Most cumulative weeks at number one † Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Presley is sometimes credited with an ""80th week"" that occurred when ""All Shook Up"" spent a ninth week on top of the ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" chart. Although Billboard's chart statistician Joel Whitburn still counts this 80th week based on preexisting research, Billboard magazine itself has since revised its methodology and officially credits Presley with 79 weeks. Much of Presley's total factors in pre-Hot 100 data. If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Fergie, if Black Eyed Peas is included, this would put Fergie on the list with 34 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Michael Jackson, if The Jackson 5, which would also be later known as The Jacksons is included, this would give Michael Jackson 47 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For singer Beyoncé, if Destiny's Child is included, this would give Beyoncé 59 cumulative weeks at #1. All six weeks from the Perfect duet with Ed Sheeran are also included. Note: For singer Diana Ross, if The Supremes are included, this would give Diana Ross 42 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For each of the Beatles: If John Lennon's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give John Lennon 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Paul McCartney's total weeks were to include the Beatles, as well as Wings, this would give Paul McCartney 89 cumulative weeks at #1. If George Harrison's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give George Harrison 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Ringo Starr's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give Ringo Starr 61 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For rapper Drake if the track ""Sicko Mode"" is included, this would put Drake on the list with 50 weeks at #1. Most consecutive number-one singles Houston's ""Thinking About You"" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio. Likewise, Perry's ""Not Like the Movies"" and ""Circle the Drain"" were only promotional singles, not radio singles. With the streak spanning from her debut single ""Vision of Love"" until ""Emotions,"" Mariah Carey became the first artist in Hot 100 history to have their first 5 solo singles reach #1 on the chart.

Cher (age 52 years, 297 days) is the oldest female artist to top the Hot 100. She set the record with ""Believe"" on March 13, 1999. The previous record holder was Grace Slick of Starship, who was 47 years, 156 days old when their hit ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" began its two-week reign on April 4, 1987. Michael Jackson (age 11 years, 155 days) is the youngest artist to top the Hot 100. He achieved the record, as part of the Jackson 5, with ""I Want You Back"" on January 31, 1970. Stevie Wonder (age 13 years, 89 days) is the youngest solo artist to top the Hot 100. He set the record with ""Fingertips Pt. 2"" on August 10, 1963. Little Peggy March (age 15 years, 50 days) is the youngest female artist to top the Hot 100. The song which established this record for her was ""I Will Follow Him"", which reached #1 on April 27, 1963. Fred Stobaugh (age 96 years, 23 days) is the oldest living artist to chart on the Hot 100. He was featured on the Green Shoe Studio song ""Oh Sweet Lorriane"", which ranked at #42 on September 14, 2013. The previous record was held by Tony Bennett, who was 85 years, 59 days old when his song ""Body and Soul"", a duet with Amy Winehouse, ranked at #87 on October 1, 2011. French-born Jordy Lemoine (age 5 years, 156 days) is the youngest artist to chart on the Hot 100. He established the record when his song ""Dur dur d'être bébé! (It's Tough to Be a Baby)"", where he is credited simply as Jordy, entered the chart on June 19, 1993. Gap records The longest gap between #1 hits on the Hot 100 for an artist is 24 years, 355 days by Cher. Her single ""Believe"" hit #1 on March 13, 1999, her first time on top since ""Dark Lady"" on March 23, 1974. The record for the longest wait from an artist's Hot 100 debut entry to its first #1 belongs to Santana, with 30 years between the time he first cracked the Hot 100 with ""Jingo"" (October 25, 1969) and the first of 12 weeks at #1 with ""Smooth,"" featuring Rob Thomas (October 23, 1999). When ""4th Dimension"" by Kids See Ghosts featuring Louis Prima debuted at #42 for the week of June 23, 2018, Prima became the artist with the longest overall span of singles on the Hot 100 – 57 years, 130 days on account of his single ""Wonderland by Night"" which last appeared at #89 on the Hot 100, dated February 13, 1961. Bobby Helms' ""Jingle Bell Rock"" holds the record for the longest trip to the Hot 100's top 10: 60 years and two weeks. It first appeared on the Hot 100 dated December 22, 1958 and reached the top 10 on the chart dated January 5, 2019 peaking at #8. Additionally, as his song ""Dreams"" debuted on the third Hot 100 ever, (dated August 18, 1958) Helms subsequently ends the longest wait for an artist's first top 10: 60 years, four months and two weeks. Burl Ives holds the record for the longest break between Hot 100 top 10's: He returned to the top 10 after 56 years, seven months and two weeks, when ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" reached #10 on the chart dated January 5, 2019. Mariah Carey holds the record gap between first and most recent No. 1 on the Hot 100 over the longest period of time: 29 years, four months and two weeks, dating to her first week at No. 1 on the chart dated August 4, 1990, with ""Vision of Love"" to her most recent No. 1, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", which reached number one on the chart dated December 21, 2019. Cher previously held this record over a period of 27 years and 5 months, ranging from the first of two weeks at No. 1 for ""Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves"" on November 6, 1971 to the last week at No. 1 for ""Believe"" on April 3, 1999. This record only counts Cher's solo career: if her time as part of Sonny & Cher is included, her span would cover 33 years, seven months and two weeks, starting with the first of three weeks at No. 1 for ""I Got You Babe"" with Sonny on August 14, 1965. Album achievements Most number-one singles from one album Source: Saturday Night Fever generated number-one singles for two different artists: ""How Deep Is Your Love"", ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Night Fever"" by the Bee Gees; and ""If I Can't Have You"" by Yvonne Elliman. Katy Perry's Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was a reissue of the Teenage Dream album, and featured an additional single, ""Part Of Me"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This brings her actual total to six. However, this does not count since the single comes from a reissue of the album and not the original release. Most top ten singles from one album Source: † Waiting to Exhale generated top ten singles for five different artists: ""Exhale (Shoop Shoop)"" and ""Count on Me"" by Whitney Houston (the latter with CeCe Winans), ""Not Gon' Cry"" by Mary J. Blige, ""Sittin' Up in My Room"" by Brandy, and ""Let It Flow"" by Toni Braxton. Other album achievements Janet Jackson's Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 has the most top 5 singles, with 7. Janet Jackson has the most albums with five or more Top 10 hits. Those albums are Control, Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, and janet. Drake's Scorpion places a record-breaking ALL 25 songs listed in the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, on the July 14, 2018 chart, while he still had two more songs entered, eclipsing his previous record of 22 from his album More Life about one year earlier, on April 8, 2017, and 18 from his album Views two year earlier, on May 21, 2016.

Record includes these five 1965 A-sides and ""We Can Work It Out"", which hit #1 in January 1966. Source: Selected additional Hot 100 achievements The first #1 song on the Hot 100 was ""Poor Little Fool"" by Ricky Nelson (August 4, 1958). The shortest #1 song of all time is ""Stay"" by Maurice Williams And The Zodiacs. It runs for a length of 1 minute, 38 seconds. It topped the Hot 100 for one week on November 21, 1960. The #1 song in the first week Billboard incorporated sales and airplay data from Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems was ""Set Adrift on Memory Bliss"" by P.M. Dawn (November 30, 1991). The #1 song in the first week Billboard allowed songs without a commercial single release to chart on the Hot 100 was ""I'm Your Angel"" by R. Kelly and Céline Dion (December 5, 1998). Though the song was making its first appearance on the Hot 100 that week, Billboard did not consider it a debut at #1, since it appeared on unpublished test charts prior to the allowance of airplay-only songs on the main chart. ""I'm Your Angel"" also entered the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart that week at #1, so it would have been ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 before then. The first ""airplay-only"" song to reach #1 (no points from a commercial single release) was ""Try Again"" by Aaliyah (June 17, 2000). Drake holds the record for the most entries in the Hot 100 during a one-week period, with 27 on the July 14, 2018 chart. The Beatles had long held this record, occupying 14 positions on the Hot 100 dated April 11, 1964, a feat unmatched for nearly 51 years. On March 7, 2015, Drake tied the Beatles mark, and he equaled it again on October 17 that year. Justin Bieber then reset the record to 17 on December 5, 2015, before Drake reclaimed the record with 20 on May 21, 2016, and broke his own record with 27 on July 14, 2018. Drake also holds the record for the most debuting entries on a Hot 100 chart by any artist, with 22 on July 14, 2018. Taylor Swift is the record-holder among female artists for the most simultaneous entries in the Hot 100, with 18 on the September 7, 2019 chart. Previous record holders were Billie Eilish (14), Cardi B (13), Ariana Grande (12), and Beyoncé (12). Ariana Grande is the record-holder among female artists with the most songs charting in the top 40 simultaneously, with 11 on the February 23, 2019 chart. The Beatles are the only artists to simultaneously hold the top 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 albums chart. They achieved this feat for nine consecutive weeks, from February 29, 1964, to April 25, 1964. For the first five weeks of that run, through March 28, 1964, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You"" were the #1 and #2 singles (which swapped positions during March 1964), while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles held the top 2 spots on the albums charts. For the remaining weeks of the run, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and their cover of ""Twist and Shout"" were the #1 and #2 singles, while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles continued their reign as the top 2 albums. Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney hold the record of writing all of the Top 3 singles for one week. The Gibbs co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 18, 1978 – #1 ""Night Fever"" and #2 ""Stayin' Alive"" for the Bee Gees, and #3 ""Emotion"" for Samantha Sang. Lennon and McCartney co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 14, 1964 – #1 ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", #2 ""She Loves You"", and #3 ""Please Please Me"", all for The Beatles. They continued this record the following week of March 21, 1964, when ""She Loves You"" switched places with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". The Black Eyed Peas hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time at #1 on the Hot 100, a total of 26 consecutive weeks from April to October 2009. ""Boom Boom Pow"" spent the first 12 weeks on top, with ""I Gotta Feeling"" taking over for the remaining 14 weeks. Prior to August 2009, Usher held this record, spending 19 consecutive weeks on top of the chart in 2004 with ""Yeah!"" (12 weeks at #1) and ""Burn"" (first 7 of its 8 total weeks at #1). On December 4, 2010, Rihanna's ""Only Girl (In the World)"" reached the top spot two weeks after ""What's My Name?"", becoming the first time in Hot 100 history that an album's debut single hit #1 after the second single did. Ed Sheeran became the first artist to debut more than one song in the top 10 for the same week. On the chart dated January 28, 2017, ""Shape of You"" debuted at #1, while ""Castle on the Hill"" entered at #6. Drake later achieved this feat on three separate occasions, doing so on April 8, 2017, February 3, 2018, and July 14, 2018. In the latter week, Drake broke the record by debuting four songs in the top 10. Drake is the only artist to have a number-one debut replace another number-one debut. He did this April 21, 2018, when ""Nice For What"" replaced ""God's Plan"" at the summit, after the latter had spent eleven weeks on top. Drake holds the record for being on the Hot 100 for the most consecutive weeks. He placed at least one song, either in a lead or featured role, on every chart from his debut on May 23, 2009, to August 19, 2017, for a total of 431 weeks in a row. Ariana Grande is the only artist to have the lead single from each of her first five albums debut in the Hot 100's top 10. On July 14, 2018, Drake set the record for the most songs in the top ten at once, with seven. The Beatles had previously held the record, since 1964, with five entries. Ariana Grande is the first artist whose first two number-one songs both debuted at the top. She achieved this with the songs ""Thank U, Next"" and ""7 Rings"", on the charts dated November 17, 2018 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Mariah Carey is the first artist to have a number-one single in four different decades after ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" topped the chart in January 2020 for a third consecutive week. Previously, she had fourteen number-one hits in the 1990s, four in the 2000s, and ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" starting its run at the top spot in December 2019.

https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-tower-office-tour-photos-2018-5,"Salesforce moved into a new $1 billion skyscraper in San Francisco, and the offices are unlike anything we've seen","There's no place like home. That is, unless you work in the newly opened Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, where employees at Salesforce's new global headquarters may never want to leave. The building, the tallest office tower west of the Mississippi River, opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by the who's who of San Francisco grandees on Tuesday. The event marked the culmination of a decades-long building and planning process for the $1.1 billion skyscraper. Business Insider went inside Salesforce Tower to see what it's like to work there. Take a look. Salesforce Tower rises 61 stories over San Francisco's Transbay district, a downtown center that's starting to get crowded with marquee tech companies including Facebook and LinkedIn. It's next-door neighbors with San Francisco's tilting, sinking skyscraper, Millennium Tower. Read more: A 58-story skyscraper in San Francisco is tilting and sinking — and residents say their multimillion-dollar condos are 'nearly worthless' Salesforce Tower was originally named Transbay Tower, but the enterprise giant bought the naming rights in a landmark real-estate deal. Salesforce will pay the developer Boston Properties close to $560 million over 15 and a half years to lease 30 floors at the building. Although it dominates San Francisco's skyline, Salesforce Tower isn't breaking any height records. Some of the floors at the 1,070-foot tower are still under construction. We took the elevator to the eighth floor, where Salesforce employees have moved in and made themselves at home. People sit in rows of desks, which can be adjusted for any height. The color of the carpeting is meant to evoke pebbled paths for walkways and grassy areas for employee seating. There are no desks fleshed against the walls, which a Salesforce spokesperson says is to maximize the amount of natural light coming into the room. The windows stretch 10 feet tall. Salesforce Tower has a slender, tapering silhouette with curved corners. These nooks provide the perfect spot for a small team meeting or coffee with a company mentor. We noticed these weird skateboard-looking things stacked in one corner. People use the decks, made by tech firm Fluidstance, as balance boards at their standing desks. Employees might instead sprawl across a common area, which typically has comfy seating and snacks located nearby. A spokesperson says the seating areas on every floor are located where the views are best. The eighth floor provides a stunning view of the rooftop park above the Transbay Transit Center, which features winding footpaths and botanical gardens. It's still under construction. Read more: San Francisco's new $2.3 billion transit center could be the most expensive bus terminal in the world Salesforce Tower doesn't have a dining hall — a staple of most big tech campuses. A spokesperson says this was deliberate; the company wants to encourage employees to step outside and buy lunch from one of the many restaurants and stores in the neighborhood. Still, the kitchen comes stocked with fresh fruit, coffee, and sodas. The kitchen and lounge area felt more like someone's living room than an employee lounge. The media center contained books on mindfulness and ""compassionate capitalism."" These bobbleheads of Salesforce founders Parker Harris and Marc Benioff smiled on employees. Thanks to the several photos of monks on the walls of the eighth floor, the office felt more like Benioff's living room than anything else. The CEO is a big fan of meditation and mindfulness. Every floor at Salesforce Tower has a meditation room, where employees can seek a moment of zen. There are floor pillows and books on mindfulness for instruction and inspiration. An iPad plays guided meditations that last between five and 20 minutes three times an hour. Employees can leave their digital devices at the door. What struck us most about the new Salesforce Tower is how ""un-techy"" it felt. The company did away with the modern, minimalist design that's favored at big tech campuses like those of Google and Facebook, in favor of a homey, relaxed vibe. Welcome to your new global headquarters, Salesforce!",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density,United States cities by population density,"The following is a list of incorporated places in the United States with a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is defined as a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been ""incorporated"" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated and so an ""incorporated place"" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township. The other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below. Incorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile The following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2010 U.S. Census, except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state, and ranked by total population; the population density for each place is also given in the lists. The population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles; the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below. The list below only includes incorporated places of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below. The District of Columbia would be included in the list, but Washington, D.C. misses the 10,000 mark as it has a population density of 9,800 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census (as of 2013 American Community Survey estimates, however, Washington now has a density of 10,528 people per square mile). Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Census-designated places The following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if it was included in the above table of incorporated places. New York City boroughs The following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000 but it is included for comparative purposes. Puerto Rico The following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census. The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or municipio, the place is located in is also included in the table below. The municipalities are what is thought of as ""incorporated places"" in Puerto Rico because there are no subordinate governments within them, only eight electoral districts which hold no administrative functions (the electoral districts are what generally constitute the census-designated places in this list below). No municipalities have a density over 10,000 as of the 2000 U.S. Census; the San Juan Municipio is the densest at 9,084.4 people per square mile. The Jayuya municipality is not part of any metropolitan area as it is only part of the Jayuya micropolitan area (see Puerto Rico census statistical areas). The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Northern Mariana Islands In the Northern Mariana Islands, there is one place that has more than 10,000 people per square mile: China Town, Northern Mariana Islands (in the 2010 U.S. Census). The other non-Puerto Rico U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) do not have any places with more than 10,000 people per square mile (as of the 2010 U.S. Census). China Town, Northern Mariana Islands is a Census-Designated Place; it is also a village within the larger municipality of Saipan. China Town would rank 105th if it were in the first table above. List of incorporated cities in the United States with over 75,000 residents Below is a list of the most densely populated cities in the United States which have a population density over 10,000 people per square mile and have a total population of over 75,000 according to the 2010 Census. This list relates to the first list, but excludes cities under 75,000.  Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Distributions The following distributions only include the 125 incorporated places with population densities over 10,000 people per square mile. They do not include the 36 census-designated places, the boroughs of New York City, or the 11 places in Puerto Rico with densities over 10,000. Metropolitan areas The following ranks United States metropolitan areas by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 within them. If two or more metropolitan areas have the same number of incorporated places, as is the case of the eight metros with one place, the metro areas are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the metro area. States and territories The following ranks the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 inhabited U.S. territories by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 people within them. The ""10,000+ places"" column only includes incorporated places, it does not include census-designated places (CDPs). If two or more states have the same number of places, as is the case of the 36 states that contain no incorporated places with a density over 10,000, the states are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the state. The density figures for the densest incorporated place within each state and territory are from the 2010 United States Census, and all the data for this ranking is from the U.S. Census Bureau. The first rank column ranks each state by the number of 10,000+ places in that state (New Jersey ranks first, California ranks second, etc.) The second rank column ranks the most densely populated place in each state or territory (Guttenberg, NJ ranks first, Kaser, NY ranks second, etc.) Hawaii officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the city of Honolulu is coextensive with Honolulu County, which makes up the whole island of Oahu. When the U.S. Census Bureau ranks incorporated places by population, it usually includes the Honolulu census-designated place, which is the urban center of Honolulu, in its ranking of incorporated places. Therefore, for this list of the densest incorporated places by state, the Honolulu CDP is considered the densest incorporated place in Hawaii. The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories are also included in this list. Puerto Rico also officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the lowest form of local government in Puerto Rico are the municipios, which are equivalent to counties. For this ranking, the municipios are counted as the incorporated places in Puerto Rico, and the San Juan Municipio is the densest. In American Samoa, each village is governed by a pulenu'u (the equivalent of a mayor) — as such, each village in American Samoa can be considered to be incorporated for the purposes of the table below. In the Northern Mariana Islands, each municipality (such as Saipan) is governed by a mayor, and so those municipalities can be considered incorporated — the villages in the Northern Mariana Islands are considered Census-Designated Places. In Guam, each village is governed by a mayor, and so those villages can be considered incorporated. For the purposes of the table below, the major towns of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Charlotte Amalie, Frederiksted and Christiansted) are considered to be incorporated. Note: this table contains data from the 2010 U.S. Census — because of this, data is more than 9 years old, and the current population density of each jurisdiction may have changed since then. Populations New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia are the only incorporated places in the United States that have a population over 1,000,000 and a population density over 10,000 people per square mile.

https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/badge-engineering-and-shared-platforms-explained-46873,Badge engineering and shared platforms explained,"The badge on the nose may be unique but your car's chassis can be quite common. That cute Italian sports car you spotted in the traffic may not be as European as it seems. Or the hatch from the intriguing new brand might not be as new as it appears. Car makers are hopping into bed with each other more than ever, making it hard for consumers to tell whether their car is unique, or a twin-under-the-skin with another brand. In what's called platform sharing, Mazda's BT-50 and Ford's Ranger have the same underpinnings. As do the Infiniti Q30 and the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. Fiat's Abarth 124 convertible was built in Hiroshima — by Mazda — while Audi's A4 shares an engine and other components with the humble Volkswagen Passat. The basic idea is to spread the huge development costs of a new vehicle over as many cars as possible. It's not the latest wheeze, either. Ford and Mazda did it in the 1980s with the Laser and 323; Holden and Toyota reached a new low when Commodores were rebadged as Lexcens and Camrys became Apollos. They were clumsy efforts, where the two cars were identical twins with only the badges changed or a minor bumper redesign. Today's twins are harder to spot. Fiat's Abarth shares its platform with the Mazda MX-5 but every panel on the Abarth is different. It also has a different engine, different brakes, unique seats and more. The Q30 and the Mercedes-Benz share telltale signs — the buttons and switches in the Infiniti are from Mercedes-Benz. The same applies to Tesla, which uses Benz switches, controls — and even cupholders. The basic idea is to spread the huge development costs of a new vehicle over as many cars as possible. The shared ethos is on the items customers can't see or feel, such as the airconditioning, while each brand focuses on the unique elements of styling and driving characteristics. Sometimes though, it doesn't matter. If the formula is right and the pricing is competitive, people will vote for their preferred brand. The cars can still look, feel and even sound very different to drive. Take the Ranger/BT-50 pick-up battle. Ford outsold Mazda by three to one last month despite charging up to $7000 more for what is essentially the same vehicle, albeit with some minor feature and technology updates. Why? Because the Ford looks tougher and the company has a reputation for building tough vehicles (remember the Territory and Falcon ute?) and it rides marginally better, loaded or unloaded. Sometimes though, it doesn't matter. If the formula is right and the pricing is competitive, people will vote for their preferred brand. Subaru and Toyota respectively built the BRZ and 86 coupes in a joint venture — and continuing strong sales of both models globally compared to the average sports car shows customers aren't overly concerned about shared chassis and engines, nor about cars with fundamental similarities in looks and features. Subaru Australia spokesman David Rowley believes brand preference plays a role in the BRZ/86 decision, given their joint genesis. ""They're obviously very close cars and the consumers know it. Part of deciding which to buy, I think, comes down to the cachet of the brand,"" Rowley says. ""The overriding feedback we get is the cars are just good value and take you back to the days when it was fun to drive,"" For the Renault-Nissan alliance, the abiding philosophy is that bigger is better, as evidenced by Renault formally taking a controlling stake in Mitsubishi last week. New chairman-elect Carlos Ghosn (already chairman and CEO of Renault-Nissan) cites common vehicle platforms and technology sharing as core ways to revitalise the Japanese brand. Carsguide believes that's likely to mean the long-term demise of the ASX, Outlander and Triton platforms (though probably not the names) in favour of vehicles sharing the Qashqai, X-Trail and Navara platforms respectively. Right now the Renault-Nissan group uses the same modular platform to build the Nissan X-Trail, Renault Koleos, Nissan Qashqai and Renault Megane. Mercedes-Benz Australia spokesman David McCarthy says adapting another manufacturer's platform can assist companies wanting quick access to a segment. Nissan Australia spokesman Peter Fadeyev says sharing components cuts development costs and lowers retail prices, which helps with the competitiveness and popularity of all the models involved. He's hoping the same dynamic works with the Daimler tie-in. The just-launched Infiniti Q30 and QX30 share the Mercedes-Benz small car chassis and engines. Benz in turn is developing a prestige pick-up based on the Navara — and Renault is throwing its hat in the ring with a Navara-based one-tonner. Mercedes-Benz Australia spokesman David McCarthy says adapting another manufacturer's platform can assist companies wanting quick access to a segment. ""There are advantages for both parties but when (the pick-up) goes on sale it will be a Mercedes-Benz engineered and designed vehicle based on a donor chassis. We're dealing with a different customer segment to Nissan and the car has to meet the expectations people have of our vehicles."" VW Group was the modular platform pioneer, extending the concept to modular engine ranges for multiple brands. The savings on development costs were bolstered by production line efficiencies, while each brand had fewer unique parts, reducing the inventories and overheads. Shared platforms now underpin Skoda, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini vehicles. The strategy was so smart, other companies followed suit. Fiat-Chrysler saved money and gained engineering clout by not having to independently develop platforms. The Fiat 500X and Jeep Renegade have common structures; so too the Alfa Romeo Giulietta and Jeep Cherokee. Toyota and BMW are co-developing a new sports car to replace the German brand's and Toyota's Supra. The Hyundai group also benefits from platform sharing. Its Hyundai and Kia brands look markedly different but share underpinnings, as in the Tucson and Sportage SUVs. No one does diversification better than the VW Group. Here are 22 vehicles built on its most common platforms. Skoda Yeti, Rapid, Fabia, Octavia, Superb, VW Golf, Tiguan, Audi A3, Q3, TT, VW Passat. Audi A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q5, Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus, Porsche Macan, VW Touareg. Before platform sharing there was badge swapping. Australians weren't keen on buying a fairly distinctive car with another marque's brand glued on the grille. The badge-engineering was part of a Federal Government plan in the 1980s and '90s to reduce import tariffs and improve the competitiveness of locally made cars by rationalising the range. It failed. Customers couldn't see the point in buying, for example, a Nissan Pulsar with a Holden Astra badge. Holden later teamed with Toyota to produce the Nova and Apollo, based on the Corolla and Camry respectively. Toyota sold the Lexcen, a renamed Commodore. Ford was a pioneer in economies of scale with companies it had invested in. Most of them failed but ironically the discipline and upgraded factories helped many Ford surrogates to survive. The US juggernaut bought a 25 per cent stake in Mazda and used the 323 platform to develop the Laser. It was a success here largely because the Ford was seen as ""locally built"" against the imported Mazda. Investments in Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo weren't as profitable. Ford revitalised the British brand but lost billions before selling to Tata in 2008 — not before producing Jag's unloved X-Type, a mildly madeover Mondeo. Its short-lived Volvo marriage gave Ford access to the five-cylinder engine used in the previous generation Focus RS. It led also to one of the original shared platforms, the C1 in 2003, used under the Focus, Mazda3 and Volvo's S40 and S50 sedans and C40 hatch.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fastest_production_cars_by_acceleration,Fastest production cars by acceleration,"This list is limited to unmodified production cars which meet the eligibility criteria below. All entries must be able to be verified from reliable sources. Eligible cars Because of the inconsistencies with the various definitions of production cars, dubious claims by manufacturers and self-interest groups, and inconsistent or changing application of the definitions, this list has a defined set of requirements. For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the links above. Production car definition For the purposes of this list a production car is defined as: Being constructed principally for retail sale to consumers for their personal use, and to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible); Fitted with the original manufacturer-supplied road tires; Having had 25 or more instances made by the original vehicle manufacturer and offered for commercial sale to the public in new condition (cars modified by either professional tuners or individuals are not eligible); Being street-legal in their intended markets and capable of passing any official tests or inspections required to be granted this status. Further limitations For the purpose of manageability, this list is limited to production cars that are able to reach 0–100 km/h time or 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 3.0 seconds or less for the first list or cover a quarter-mile (402 m) from a standing start in 11.0 seconds or less for the second list. By 0–100 km/h time or 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) (3.0 seconds or less) If an independent time becomes available, that time will be listed over the manufacturer's time regardless if the latter is quicker. Many elements change how fast the car can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph).  Tires, elevation above sea level, weight of the driver, testing equipment, weather conditions and surface of testing track all influence these times. Some measurements exclude the first foot-rollout. By 1/4 mile or 400 metre times (11 seconds or less) Table notes Various factors can contribute to variability in car speed test results. British and U.S. car measurements quote 0–60 miles/hour and 1/4 mile times while European car measurements quote 0–100 kilometers/hour and 400 meter times (which translate to 0–96.5606 kilometers/hour and 402.336 meter times, or to 0–62.1371 miles/hour and 1/4.02336 mile times, respectively) Some measurements exclude an initial ""rollout"", which according to Car and Driver ""can affect the elapsed time by as much as 0.3 second"". Furthermore, environmental conditions change how fast the car drives (tires, surface of testing track, elevation above sea level, weight of the driver, and equipment used for testing are all critical). Times sourced for example by Car and Driver, are modified artificially using computer software after the drive test is complete, to theoretically account for how the car would have performed differently given different weather conditions. Car models similar to an already mentioned model but differentiated only by minor package options (for example ""convertible editions"") are omitted acknowledging that speed results with those editions can be only slightly less fast. In the case of a tie between two cars, since there exist a variety of different opinions regarding the interpretation of, for example, 1/4 mile trap speed results, the car shown first is the one with the earlier model year (of the fast time's represented model, and not necessarily of any driven car) or if both years are the same it goes to the car having the earliest date associated with the performance data's verification or publishing. This is the earliest model year of the car that can claim all its following listed data. This is not necessarily the model year of any driven car, the year when testing was performed, the year during which owners took first delivery of the model, the year it was unveiled, or when it was built. This is the fastest result provided by independent sources or the manufacturer. This is the fastest result provided by independent sources. This is the result shown by the manufacturer.

For Tesla, the ""model year"" of any given car is the same as the calendar year that the car was produced but changes and updates, both in hardware and software, are pushed out whenever they are deemed ready. That said, for the purposes of this list, the ""earliest model year of the car that can claim all its following listed data"" (as per the note at the top of the ""Year"" column) is technically 2016 for the Model S P100D and the Model X P100D since that is when the 100kWh battery option was introduced even though the software update that made it possible to achieve the times currently listed was only released in 2017. All instances of the Model S P100D and Model X P100D are capable of claiming all their respective listed data if their software are updated to at least the revision which includes the ""Ludicrous+"" code.

Ferrari didn't allow standard tests on neutral ground for the LaFerrari, the acceleration numbers in the magazines were obtained downhill on the Ferrari test track with a specially prepared car on Ferrari's terms. Motor Trend´s LaFerrari report published a 9.7 second 1/4 mile only after each 9.9 second result was rewritten to account for weather, and it also revealed that standard car tests performed by Motor Trend involve multiple runs, driving forward in both directions to then compute averages, stating, ""Fiorano’s downhill front straight was the only place we were allowed to do acceleration runs, and we couldn’t run backward for a two-way average. The data shows the fastest quarter-mile run declining by 18.2 feet from start to finish, or 1.4 percent. For reference, the National Hot Rod Association allows a 1.0 percent maximum grade over the course of a quarter mile. It’s difficult to say how much of an advantage this gives the LaFerrari, but it helps enough that we’ll asterisk these results until we can test a car on level ground"". 11.03 sec @ 141.75 mph were measured on neutral ground. of which 30 were Super Sport 8-speed automatic, all wheel drive, twin turbocharged, sedan all-wheel drive, SUV 9-speed automatic, all wheel drive, twin turbocharged, sedan including Coupé and Spider combined Pre-production, prepared dragstrip, 100-octane fuel.

But actor Larry Wilcox narrowly escaped the long arm of the law himself today after being sentences to three years probation for securities fraud - avoiding possible jail time. The 63-year-old actor, who starred alongside Erik Estrada in the much loved show, faced a possible five years in jail for conspiracy to commit securities fraud after being caught in an FBI sting operation in Florida. He was also ordered to pay a $100 fine and carry out 500 hours of community service. 'I think we got an individual who is truly remorseful,' US District Judge James Cohn said. 'He should not be punished because of his celebrity status.' Wilcox played Officer Jonathan 'Jon' Baker on the show, opposite Erik Estrada as Officer Frank 'Ponch' Poncherello. Wilcox left the show a year before it ended its NBC run from 1977-83. He wiped away tears as he addressed the court before sentencing. 'I spent 63 years putting my signature on my life,' Wilcox said after clearing his throat to speak to the court. 'I betrayed my core values with what I did.

https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/20-working-musicians-over-75.html,20 Working Musicians Over 75,"They say that age is a state of mind. For some ageing musicians, the only state of mind they ever had to be concerned with was that state of mind that was chemically induced. They also say that 50 is the new 40, that 40 is the new 30, and that 30 is the new 20, so can't it also be said that 80 is the new 70 and 70 is the new 60? Or does even matter? Today, musicians are rocking well into their 70s, with a significant number into their 80s. If rock 'n' roll was once the pursuit of the young, then clearly the rules have changed. Youth may progress the form and creation of music, but the energy and exuberance expressed by those of the older generation remains unabated. With “”Oldchella serving as a recent reminder (and in honor of Leonard Cohen's passing yesterday), here 20 musicians who are still thriving in their twilight years. Age: 90 If any rocker set the template for rock 'n' roll, it's the indomitable Chuck Berry. While he may not be able to do his famous duck walk as well as he used to, he's still making music. On his 90th birthday last month, he announced a forthcoming new album, Chuck, due for release next year. Dedicated to Themetta Berry, his wife of 69 years and featuring help from his two children, Charles Jr. and Ingrid, it will mark his first new record in 38 years. He still lives near St. Louis and continues to perform at least once a month, at a restaurant called Blueberry Hill where he retains a residency every Wednesday. To paraphrase a title from one of his classics, catch him while you can. Age: 90 Having just entered his tenth decade, Tony Bennett remains as active as ever, teaming with Lady Gaga, maintaining a busy touring schedule and still managing to hold on to his persona as a king of croon. Indeed, he's singing as well as ever. Yours truly shared a limousine ride with him 25 years ago when he was a youthful 65, and found him to be one of the nicest members of the showbiz elite one would every encounter. You might have left your heart in San Francisco, Mr. Bennett, but you've stolen ours in the interim. Age: 89 Although he's retired from performing, Belafonte remains as busy as ever, as both an activist and an advocate. He helped organize the USA for Africa campaign/supergroup and continues to play a principle role in civil rights up through the present day. A committed artist and humanitarian, his name will forever be enshrined among those who not only talked about change, but actually helped make it happen. Age: 88 After turning out a series of chart-topping barroom ballads in the '60s and '70s, Bacharach went on to work with any number of contemporary stars, even making an album with Elvis Costello that surprised many folks and impressed even more. A recently released live DVD aptly entitled A Life In Song serves as a remarkable reminder of the indelible impression Bacharach has left on modern music. Age: 88 Although he's not nearly as active as he once was, the man who originally recorded “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain't That a Shame” and “I'm Walkin” turned his barrelhouse piano style and New Orleans heritage into his own singular success. The esteem in which he is held was personified by the 2007 album Going Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino, which featured such stars as Paul McCartney, Willie Nelson, Neil Young, Norah Jones and Elton John singing his songs and echoing his praises. Age: 84 Still the reigning queen of classic country, Lynn isn't content to rest on her accomplishments. She just released her first Christmas album, White Christmas Blue, a follow up to the stunningly successful album she released last year, Full Circle, which featured guest appearances from Willie Nelson and Elvis Costello. Just over a decade ago she returned to the spotlight with Van Lear Rose, produced by her pal Jack White. It found her reaching a new plateau and forever enshrined her as an eternal superstar. More than a Coal Miner's Daughter, she's one of the parents of modern Americana. Age: 83 Once known as the woman who broke up The Beatles, Yoko has outlasted her critics and gained new respect for her lingering influence on experimental music and avant-garde attitude in general. She's gained new respectability since her husband's murder, with any number of artists, from The B-52's to Lene Lovich, citing her influence on their own endeavors. Yes, she's still outrageous, but no one can doubt that she's as ambitious as ever. Age: 83 Willie may remain irascible, but his prodigious outflow of new albums shows he's also in a motivated mindset. Who says pot can kill your ambition? Willie's made music in practically every genre known to man, and he still tours relentlessly in his smoky bus. “On the Road Again” is about more than the music. It's his mantra, as well. Age: 83 An exceptional chanteuse, Clark's claim to fame began in the '60s with such songs as “Downtown” and “Don't Sleep in the Subway.” Still performing before adoring masses worldwide, she remains elegant as ever. Her 2011 remake of “Downtown” paired her with the Irish band the Saw Doctors. While they sang her praises, she still sings like a songbird. Age: 81 One of rock's most enduring elder statesman, Lewis was also one of its rowdiest. Along with Little Richard (now retired), Lewis made the piano an ideal platform for onstage theatrics. A brawler and a bad boy, he made international headlines when he married his underage cousin; he personified the image of the unrepentant rocker. His latest album, Rock and Roll Time, featuring an array of special guests, attests to the fact the The Killer is still cool. Age: 83 One of the most influential jazz musicians of all time, Shorter was hailed by The New York Times as, “probably jazz's greatest living small-group composer and a contender for greatest living improviser.” Having played with both Miles Davis and the great fusion band Weather Report, he recently put together a new outfit named Mega Nova with bassist Marcus Miller and drummer Cindy Blackman Santana. Age: 82 Mr. Mayall, long considered the father of British blues, has grandfathered many of England's most prodigal sons —Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood and Jack Bruce among the very many. In fact, had it not been for Mayall and his band the Bluesbreakers, many of these acclaimed artists would have found a far more difficult route to the top rungs of success. Now rapidly approaching his 83rd birthday, he still tours relentlessly and, equally impressively, still blows a mean harmonic on his classic “Room to Move.” Once a purveyor of porn, we can only wonder if age has slowed him down in that arena as well. Age: 81 One of the original outlaws of modern country music, Bare's devotion to cause remains undiminished, so much so that his son Bobby Bare, Jr. continues in that tradition, too. Sr.'s most recent album, Darker Than Light, was his first album in seven years and features some spirited covers. It's proof that despite his age, he still retains contemporary credence. Age: 81 The surviving member of one of the greatest soul duos ever, Sam and Dave, Moore is not only active, but seemingly at the peak of his powers. A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he's still knocking them dead in his live performances. Hold on, he's still coming. Age: 80 What a guy, that Buddy Guy. One of the few remaining true blues icons, he's still out on the road, showing the same grit and confidence in his fretwork as he did when he famously chummed around with Jimi Hendrix. Eric Clapton once declared, “Buddy Guy was to me what Elvis was for others.” Stevie Ray Vaughn added his own accolades, stating, “Without Buddy Guy, there would be no Stevie Ray Vaughan.” That list could certainly be expanded to include any number of other luminaries as well. Age: 80 Despite reports of his failing health, Kristofferson still managed to release an album last year entitled The Cedar Creek Sessions. He hasn't announced plans to retire any time soon, although he has made it clear that he's living up to this lyric, borrowed from Leonard Cohen's song “Bird on a Wire,” which he requested to be imprinted on his tombstone: “Like a bird on the wire / Like a drunk in a midnight choir / I have tried in my way to be free.” His renegade persona lives on. Age: 80 Having just reached a crucial milestone, Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman proves that age has nothing to do with endurance. The fact is, the guy looks a lot better than he did back in the day when the Stones were widely derided and called the ugliest band ever. Nevertheless, Wyman was considerably older than his contemporaries even early on; when the Stones hit their prime in '65 and '66, he was already nearly 30, an old age in an era of youthful exuberance. Age: 76 As hard as it is to imagine there's a Beatle who is 76 (Macca doesn't make this list because he's still under 75), it's also hard to imagine that Ringo is also a great grandfather! Nevertheless, it's all peace and love as far as he's concerned, and his All Starr band is still stable 30 years on. Age: 75 At an age when most senior citizens have long since retired, Dylan continues to tour relentlessly, pausing only to take time to accept his recently awarded Nobel Prize for Literature. If he has a bucket list, it's near impossible to imagine what remains on it. His only concession to age are his recent recordings of standards, but given his amazing collection of signature songs, we'll forgive him for taking a pause from any current compositions. Age: 75 We're singling out Stones drummer Charlie Watts because at the ripe old age of 75, he represents the transition from youthful insolence to distinguished reserve. Really though, it's more an excuse for us to mention that at this point, the combined age of all four charter members of the Stones is nearly 190. The '60s may have passed, but the 70-somethings survive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age,Presidents of the United States by age,"This is a list of presidents of the United States by age. The first table charts the age of each United States president at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the president is still living, their lifespan is calculated up to January 6, 2020. The second table includes those presidents who had the distinction among their peers of being the oldest living president, and charts both when they became and ceased to be the oldest living. Age of presidents The median age upon accession to the presidency is 55 years and 3 months. This is how old Lyndon B. Johnson was at the time of his first inauguration. The youngest person to assume the presidency was Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded to the office at the age of 42 years, 322 days after the assassination of William McKinley (the youngest to become president after having been elected was John F. Kennedy, who was 43 years, 236 days of age on Inauguration Day). The oldest person to be elected to a first term was Donald Trump, who became president at the age of 70 years, 220 days. Assassinated three years into his term, John F. Kennedy was the youngest at the time of his departure from office (46 years, 177 days); the youngest president to leave office at the conclusion of a normal transition was Theodore Roosevelt (50 years, 128 days). The oldest at the time of leaving office was Ronald Reagan (77 years, 349 days). The president born after the greatest number of their successors is John F. Kennedy. He was born after four of his successors: Lyndon Johnson (8 years, 9 months, and 2 days); Ronald Reagan (6 years, 3 months, and 23 days); Richard Nixon (4 years, 4 months, and 16 days); and Gerald Ford (3 years, 10 months, and 15 days). On the other extreme, Ronald Reagan was born before four of his predecessors: Richard Nixon (1 year, 11 months, and 7 days); Gerald Ford (2 years, 5 months, and 8 days); John F. Kennedy (6 years, 3 months, and 23 days); and Jimmy Carter (13 years, 7 months, and 25 days). The oldest living U.S. president is Jimmy Carter, born October 1, 1924 (age 95 years, 97 days). On March 22, 2019, he also became the nation's longest-lived president, surpassing the lifespan of George H. W. Bush, who died at the age of 94 years, 171 days. Additionally, Carter has the distinction of having the longest post-presidency in U.S. history, currently at 38 years, 351 days. The youngest living president is Barack Obama, born August 4, 1961 (age 58 years, 155 days). The shortest-lived president to have died by natural causes (thereby excluding John F. Kennedy and James A. Garfield, who were both assassinated) was James K. Polk, who died of cholera at the age of 53 years, 225 days; only 103 days after leaving office. Six U.S. presidents have lived into their 90s. The first to do so, John Adams, held the distinction of being the longest-lived president for nearly two centuries, from 1803 until Ronald Reagan surpassed his lifespan in October 2001. The six nonagenarian presidents (ordered by lifespan) are: Presidential age-related data points Oldest living Of the 44 people who have served as president, 24 have become the oldest such individual of their time, with one, William Howard Taft, doing so twice. Herbert Hoover held the distinction for the longest period of any, from the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933 until his own death 31 years later. Lyndon B. Johnson held it for the shortest, from the death of Harry S. Truman in December 1972 until his own death only 27 days later. Theodore Roosevelt, at age 49, is the youngest individual to become the oldest living president; Jimmy Carter became the oldest to acquire the distinction at age 94. (Nine of these individuals have also had the distinction of being the oldest living U.S. vice president: John Adams, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush.) On three occasions the oldest living president lost the distinction not by his death, but by the inauguration of a president who was older: Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) to William Howard Taft (born 1857) in 1909; Taft to Woodrow Wilson (born 1856) in 1913 (though Taft later regained the honor, as he outlived Wilson); and Richard Nixon (born 1913) to Ronald Reagan (born 1911) in 1981. Eleven presidents have held the distinction while in office. In the cases of George Washington, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Ronald Reagan this occurred upon their inauguration as they were older than their living predecessors (or, in Washington's case, had no predecessors). In the cases of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon, this happened at the same time as their becoming the only living president; in the cases of Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Harrison, the only other living president at the time was a younger predecessor, John Quincy Adams and Grover Cleveland respectively. By contrast, the president who acquired the distinction furthest from his time in office was Jimmy Carter, who had been retired for 37 years, 314 days. Note * Green text and an asterisk mark the inauguration date of a president older than any living ex-president. Other dates are the deaths of the then-oldest president.",,0.607198,"[['#','President','Born','Age at start of presidency','Age at end of presidency','Post-presidency timespan','Lifespan','Lifespan']['#','President','Born','Age at start of presidency','Age at end of presidency','Post-presidency timespan','Died','Age']['1','George Washington','Feb 22, 1732','57 years, 67 days; Apr 30, 1789','65 years, 10 days; Mar 4, 1797','2 years, 285 days','Dec 14, 1799','67 years, 295 days']['2','John Adams','Oct 30, 1735','61 years, 125 days; Mar 4, 1797','65 years, 125 days; Mar 4, 1801','25 years, 122 days','Jul 4, 1826','90 years, 247 days']['3','Thomas Jefferson','Apr 13, 1743','57 years, 325 days; Mar 4, 1801','65 years, 325 days; Mar 4, 1809','17 years, 122 days','Jul 4, 1826','83 years, 82 days']['4','James Madison','Mar 16, 1751','57 years, 353 days; Mar 4, 1809','65 years, 353 days; Mar 4, 1817','19 years, 116 days','Jun 28, 1836','85 years, 104 days']['5','James Monroe','Apr 28, 1758','58 years, 310 days; Mar 4, 1817','66 years, 310 days; Mar 4, 1825','6 years, 122 days','Jul 4, 1831','73 years, 67 days']['6','John Quincy Adams','Jul 11, 1767','57 years, 236 days; Mar 4, 1825','61 years, 236 days; Mar 4, 1829','18 years, 356 days','Feb 23, 1848','80 years, 227 days']['7','Andrew Jackson','Mar 15, 1767','61 years, 354 days; Mar 4, 1829','69 years, 354 days; Mar 4, 1837','8 years, 96 days','Jun 8, 1845','78 years, 85 days']['8','Martin Van Buren','Dec 5, 1782','54 years, 89 days; Mar 4, 1837','58 years, 89 days; Mar 4, 1841','21 years, 142 days','Jul 24, 1862','79 years, 231 days']['9','William Henry Harrison','Feb 9, 1773','68 years, 23 days; Mar 4, 1841','68 years, 54 days; Apr 4, 1841','0 days','Apr 4, 1841','68 years, 54 days']['10','John Tyler','Mar 29, 1790','51 years, 6 days; Apr 4, 1841','54 years, 340 days; Mar 4, 1845','16 years, 320 days','Jan 18, 1862','71 years, 295 days']['11','James K.

https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/10/the-best-albums-of-2008.html,The 40 Best Albums of 2008,"We've been looking back at the music of 20, 30, 40 and 50 years ago with the best albums of 1998, 1988, 1978 and 1968. Now it's time to look back a decade to a year when Paste was writing about music as it happened and published our own year-end list. Many of the following albums were on that list, but we wanted to see which ones stood the test of time for our current editorial staff. The following list has the advantage of 10 years of hindsight, so it looks quite a bit different. The following 40 albums range from indie folk to loud rock to jazz, hip hop and even country. It contains a surprising number of debuts, especially near the top of the list, as 2008 saw the launch of a number of artists who continue to do great things. These are the albums that we keep going back to, a decade later, and will probably keep going back to for decades to come. As a 41-year-old father of two in 2008, Stephen Malkmus had settled into a comfortable mid-career groove, avoiding self-parody and creative complacency with a series of albums that explored his inner guitar geek while toning down his impish charm. With Real Emotional Trash, he proved he could retain both, leaving behind the controlled one-man-band environment of 2005's Face the Truth and issuing his most eclectic and unpredictable album yet. With former Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss anchoring a muscular rhythm section, Malkmus had a Jicks worthy of his trust, and here he plays with more imagination and whimsy than he had since his playful 2001 solo debut, spinning yarns about murder mysteries, and unfurling marathon guitar solos. Here, all the influences that had percolated below the surface of his body of work burst forth, as Malkmus presides over a classic-rock parallel universe where Black Sabbath doom riffs rub up against Grateful Dead boogies and Boston-aping pop anthems, with prog-rock detours and multi-section epics thrown in for good measure. —Matt Fink A decade removed from reigning over trip-hop's dark kingdom, Portishead returned in 2008 with more uneasy listening. Portishead's version of trip-hop has always overweighted the “trip” quotient when compared to hip-hop worshipping contemporaries such as DJ Shadow, UNKLE and fellow Bristolians Massive Attack and Tricky. Resident beat alchemist, Geoff Barrow was as likely to sample film-noir soundtracks or the minor-key orchestrations of Lalo Schifrin as he was to go crate-digging in the Eric B. & Rakim archives. And then there was Beth Gibbons' shadowy voice, which often sounded more like a sampled artifact than the rare grooves in which the band traded. Her voice gave Portishead's music a wounded, heartsick quality that elevated it to an altitude safe from the passing fads of pop culture. Trip-hop may have died a quiet, timely death in the intervening years, but Gibbons' otherworldly gift guaranteed that Portishead's music would survive any drought with its soul largely intact. Third is far and away the best, most punk thing in the Portishead catalog: a deeply transgressive album that bears a passing similarity to its predecessors but leaves most of the baggage behind in favor of a full-blown reset. What Barrow and Gibbons cooked up here ain't no party, ain't no disco, ain't no fooling around. Third's songs begin in a foreign tongue as though we're accidentally walking in on a scene we're not meant to see (the Portuguese soliloquy that opens “Silence”), they end without warning or are cut off in the rudest possible fashion (the tribal-sounding death knell “Nylon Smile”), and they strike Teutonic poses that seem more like Krautrock-meets-“Bela Lugosi's Dead” (the devastating “We Carry On,” the electronic weaponry of “Machine Gun”) than the mood music for which Portishead is known. —Corey DuBrowa English rockers Foals kicked off their career under the equine name with the anxiety punk of their debut album Antidotes. Influenced by pop music, some of the album's repetitive, dancey tracks are much heavier and lyrically darker than their pop counterparts. On “Cassius” the flittering guitar riff is like filigree in the pounding momentum of the song. The vocals of lead singer Yannis Philippakis push the song forward, each syllable sticking out. “Cassius these daydreams, these daydreams decay!” he sings. Philippakis' gruff and shouted singing adds a roughness to the band's already jittery sound, and so they play and dance on a ledge—moments away from barreling out of control, but in a way that feels like release. Even the melancholic lyrics can't drag down the pace; instead they evoke the thought that if we're going to die we might as well also dance, which is essentially what “Two Steps, Twice” chants: “Sun side dance step for two/ Sunset disco this is for you.” On the head-bobbing “Electric Bloom” the instrument panning pulls the ear one way then another, almost distracting from Philippakis' voice beaming straight down the center. “It's just another hospital,” he sings, the awareness of death threatening to sink the song into gloom while the bright keys keep it above water. —Anna Haas Mark Kozelek's Ohio childhood, his classic-rock album collection, his love for the guitar, his friends and especially the death of loved ones—including the tragic passing of an important early muse—have made him the songwriter he is. He takes solace in the beautiful landscapes that surround him. He travels to faraway cities and dreams of home, and then he comes home and dreams of elsewhere. He's always been obsessed by longing and desire. 1992's accomplished Red House Painters demo-tape-turned-debut-album Down Colorful Hill was a Technicolor tragedy filled with tortured romances and aching childhood memories, a perfect fit for the boutique 4AD label that released it. The young man who composed that record has changed over the years. Nothing dramatic, no abrupt refutations of his past; just a deepening, a settling into the man he has become. Kozelek's music on April is warmer, more able to reconcile its classic-rock roots within its ethereal structures. The reverb canyons and domineering vocals have given way to richer guitar textures and sweet, anguished mumbles. His songs remain personal, as likely to express shockingly candid details as to wrap them in personal symbolism only he can unravel. When Kozelek sings “I promised always through me she would shine” on April's 10-minute centerpiece “Tonight the Sky,” you picture the man alone, howling at the moon, shaking his fists in frustration at the universe. —Rob O'Connor Jamey Johnson looks like an escapee from The Hell's Angels, so you'd be forgiven if you expected some sort of death metal caterwaul to erupt from your stereo speakers. Instead, Johnson sounds like a good ol' boy from Montgomery, Ala., which is what he is, and his second album, That Lonesome Song, recaptures everything that was great about those classic Merle Haggard and George Jones honky-tonk singles from the mid-to-late '60s. The pedal steel weeps, the lead guitar rumbles deep in the bass range, and Johnson unleashes one of those voices that is equal parts heavenly soul and red clay dirt. Like another good ol' boy from Montgomery, Hank Williams, Jamey's lived a hard life. After an eight-year stint in the marines, Johnson got off to a belated start, recorded the superb 2005 debut album The Dollar, which was both a critical and commercial smash, and then proceeded to drink and drug himself right out of a career. Erratic gigs, the emotional devastation resulting from a separation and divorce, and general boorish, obnoxious behavior led to him being dropped from his first label in 2007. For the record, you have to work pretty hard to do this when your first album generates a Top 10 hit. But give the man credit. He screwed it up royally. But he returned with the best country record released in 2008. Hands down. Chronicling the sordid and sad events of the three prior years, That Lonesome Song is both a traditional country music tour de force and a harrowing singer/songwriter confessional album. Imagine Late for the Sky-era Jackson Browne hitchhiking to Redneckville and given a George Jones voice transplant. This is wild, untamed music sung in a wild, untamed voice, and it's brilliant. —Andy Whitman Though 2008 found Deerhunter's lead singer Bradford Cox trading dresses, rants and provocations for a steady, serious normality, Microcastle still finds him uncertain and a bit paranoid (on “Agoraphobia,” he blurs the distinctions between “cover me,” “comfort me” and “come for me”), but the shifts from languid ambience to hard-edged rock are much less stark than on the band's previous album. Indeed, if Cryptograms asked the listener to swim around in the murky depths before shaking a fist in the air, Microcastle is instantly ingratiating. The short intro is a burst of almost kitschy instrumental lushness, while “Never Stops” is a pulsing, revelatory masterpiece, its shimmering guitars meshing beautifully with Cox's hypnotic voice. The rest of the album balances the meditative and the direct, but it's the uptempo songs that leave the strongest impression. On Microcastle, Deerhunter has written genuine anthems. —Mark Krotov Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner dreamed up an improbable side project with fellow 22-year-old Miles Kane (of Brit band The Rascals), featuring youthful takes on the melodramatic '60s pop once proffered by Shirley Bassey, Anthony Newley and James Bond composer John Barry. Composed by the little-known Owen Pallett, production numbers like sultry tune “The Chamber,” Brecht-Weill-style drinking song “Calm Like You” and the over-the-top title track come across with the playfully surreal grandiosity and twisted charm of 2007's The Good, the Bad and the Queen, Damon Albarn's project with similarly string-crazed trickster Danger Mouse. (My suspicion is that Pallett is Danger Mouse, and that Kane is Turner.) This record is not for everybody—including, I suspect, the majority of Arctic Monkeys fans. Nonetheless, Turner deserves props for unleashing his inner Bowie and embracing artifice with such nerve and verve. —Bud Scoppa Although Jack White had previously played the part of both the coy adolescent and the Southern-gentleman-on-the-skids, the lead White Stripe's work with the Raconteurs is perhaps most akin to late musical puberty. Given the former Jack Gillis's preoccupation with stage character, it doesn't seem far-fetched to hear the Raconteurs as an acknowledgment that White needed a new creative persona to deal with the tingly arena-rock feelings he'd been having. With a machine-gun groove, parts of the opening title track on Consolers of the Lonely, sound like the “love gun's loaded” bridge to Spinal Tap's “Big Bottom.” And while one can easily imagine smoke machines spurting during many of the album's 13 other tracks, there is no irony in the mix. Just fun. After all, it's Jack White and the dudes: indie-pop charmer Brendan Benson and the Greenhornes' Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. Sometimes, White and Benson play off each other in pleasingly predictable ways. On “You Don't Understand Me,” they pull a Lennon/McCartney: White digs into a typical put-down ballad before they alight into a rich, obvious Benson chorus, eventually combining to echo one another. There's also the spitfire joy of “Salute Your Solution” and plenty that sounds like it could've been on a Stripes disc, like the Stonesy refrain of “Hold Up.” The negative space White carved between the Stripes' peppermint swirls remains such a strong gravitational force that it all but carries the record. The Raconteurs make big, joyous songs with all the trappings of delicious summer jams. —Jesse Jarnow Lucinda Williams has a great laugh—it's a joyful sound to hear on the aptly titled Little Honey, the 10th album in her now-four-decade career. A sweet sense of renewal imbues the album, which encompasses all the elements of her eclectic catalog with varied, impeccable writing. Aided by loose-limbed playing from her band Buick 6, some notable party guests, and a voice full of everything from righteous gusto to hard-won wisdom, Little Honey is Lucinda Williams at her best. A sharp contrast to the studied tapestry of sound and embittered lyrics of West, Little Honey finds Williams in celebratory mode, with raucous rock, bluesy testimonies and tongue-in-cheek twang. Her brooding introspection—found here on a handful of moody tone poems and mournful ballads—adds depth to the proceedings. A decade before, the Louisiana-born Williams proffered that her best work was borne of emotional crises and the ensuing solitude. But Little Honey proves that philosophy doesn't tell the whole story: This time out, Williams has found “Real Love,” the barnburner that kicks off the album, and she sings “Tears Of Joy,” a stunning Chicago-meets-Texas blues. On both tracks, her chansons d'amour are abetted by the straight-ahead backing of her touring group: longtime (for Williams) guitarist Doug Pettibone, joined by axman Chet Lyster, bassist David Sutton, and drummer Butch Norton, who give the album its punch. Little Honey is the happy ending to 1998's “Joy.” During the finale of her late-'90s concerts in ever larger halls, Williams and her band were known for vamping on the song's rhythmic hook, “You took my joy/ I want it back.” A decade later, she's got it and she gives it. How sweet it is. —Holly George-Warren On When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold, the sixth studio album from lyricist Slug and producer Ant, the duo dropped Ant's sampled beats in favor of live instrumentals to back Slug's rhymes. The move results in a sound that's far more textured and intricate than their previous five efforts and coincided with Atmosphere rounding up some uncharacteristic guest artists, including Tom Waits beat-boxing on “The Waitress” and TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe singing backing vocals on “Your Glasshouse.” Strange pairings, yes, but they work, particularly on “The Waitress,” a song written from the point of view of a homeless man that has lyrics like those straight out of Waits' catalogue. In another marked departure from Atmosphere's previous work, Slug, who typically used his rhymes as a cathartic public diary, became a storyteller, threading a fatherhood theme through all 15 songs on Lemons. The beats are a bit softer and slower here, and the lyrics a bit more dense, but repeated listens unveil a deeper side of Atmosphere—a complexity in both its lyrics and beats only hinted at previously. Listen closely, and you might just discover the maturation of Slug and Ant. —Liz Lawson It seemed like everyone was surprised when Elbow beat out the likes of Radiohead, Adele, Last Shadow Puppets, Laura Marling and more for the Mercury Prize in 2008, an annual award that goes to the best album from the UK and Ireland. But in retrospect, the Manchester rock band, helmed by frontman Guy Garvey, may have had the strongest release that year with their stunningly gorgeous The Seldom Seen Kid, a record that somehow grows even stronger with age. The group's fourth album, complete with heavily distorted guitar riffs (“Grounds for Divorce” and “The Bones of You”), life-affirming strings-backed anthems (“One Day Like This” and “Mirrorball”), and some of the most beautiful lyrics in recent memory (“You are the only thing in any room you're ever in,” “So yes I guess I'm asking you to back a horse that's good for glue and nothing else/ But find a man that's truer than, find a man who needs you more than I,” “The violets explode inside me when I meet your eyes/ Then I'm spinning and I'm diving like a cloud of starlings/ Darling, is this love?” all from album opener “Starlings), launched them to superstardom in the UK, where they performed “One Day Like This” in the 2012 Closing Ceremonies of the London Olympics. They're likely the only band that could get an entire venue to headbang one minute and prompt a man to propose to his girlfriend the next (which actually happened at their 2014 performance at Webster Hall). One of the strongest full albums of its decade, The Seldom Seen Kid is one of those records that only comes around a couple of times a generation, a pitch-perfect listen front to back. —Steven Edelstone English boarding-school alum, former choirboy, and erstwhile Royal Shakespeare Company actor Johnny Flynn goes slumming on his debut album, adopting a Dickensian ragamuffin persona that is so engaging that you quickly forget that he's never gone dumpster diving in his life. There are echoes of Trad stalwarts throughout—Martin Carthy and Mike Waterson in the singing, Bert Jansch in the supple guitar work—but Flynn is no retro iconoclast, and his biting social commentary owes more to Billy Bragg than Billy Billington. The Sussex Wit, Flynn's backing band, unleashes a frenzied Pogues approximation behind him. Alarum (a Shakespearian term for general mayhem) is a fitting title for an impressive debut. —Andy Whitman It's difficult to pinpoint the undeniable charm of The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines. The hour-long album, a compendium of 16 highlights from King Khan and the Shrines' discography, is full of upbeat garage-rock jams, from the groovy “Sweet Touch” to the swinging “Outta Harms Way.” Toronto-born Arish Khan, a confident, swaggering frontman, belts out each song like a bar-band hero working overtime. He's at his best when he's confidently driving the Shrines, a large crew supplemented by horn players and a cheerleader(!),as they run through the triumphant '60s-era soul of “Live Fast Die Strong” and devise lowdown themes like “Destroyer” and “I Wanna Be a Girl.” On The Supreme Genius of…, King Khan seems to enjoy playing a rock 'n' roll cad. —Mosi Reeves After the profile-raising success of his last album, Night Ripper, mash-up wizard Greg Gillis (aka Girl Talk) continued weaving intricate tapestries from uncleared samples of mainstream pop, rock and rap, making him seem either incredibly ballsy or kind of nuts. His second musical highlight reel is dense with rib-nudging gags and indelible moments: Gillis imagines a world where Avril Lavigne rubs shoulders with Jay-Z; The Band with Yung Joc; The Jackson 5 with the Beastie Boys—in other words, he doesn't imagine anything, because this multivalent stew is precisely the world in which we live. Gillis simply digested it into a crunky, continuous mix. There are no contradictions here; it's just like scanning across several radio stations simultaneously, while everything magically synchs up. The real fun of Feed the Animals is the act of recognition, so I won't say much more, except this—Lil Mama's “Lip Gloss” over the riff from Metallica's “One?” Damn! —Brian Howe One of the greatest jazz shows I've ever seen was Frisell's concert at Washington's Lisner Auditorium in November, 2006. Flanked by a trumpet/sax quartet on one side and a string trio on the other, sitting by an array of electric pedals, the guitarist was finally able to combine the various currents in his music: the straight-ahead post-bop, the Americana pastoralism, the chamber-jazz and the experimental electronica into one unified whole. Several songs from that evening and that tour were released as History, Mystery, persuasive evidence that Frisell has emerged as a major figure in jazz history. While others insist that jazz has to be one thing, Frisell proves that it can be many things—and here he proves those many things can happily coexist. —Geoffrey Himes We all know That Couple: professionally accomplished, interpersonally fluid, slaloming between challenges as though doing nothing more demanding than strolling down senior hall from Trig to AP English (yawn). Then the kids came, and That Couple pulled off parenthood with aplomb as well, their rug monkeys demonstrating enviable manners and scarily perfect genetics. It's enough to make most mere mortals throw up their hands in frustration. Mates of State's husband-and-wife team, keyboardist Kori Gardner and drummer Jason Hammel sing in close harmonies. They are indie-rock's That Couple, and Re-Arrange Us is their fifth attempt to perfect the sunny-day real estate they've claimed as their terra firma. It's a record about life's small domestic joys, sung with enough gusto and bug-eyed wonder to make you question how in the world you've overlooked such unappreciated gems as household color schemes (the rolling cadences of “Get Better”), patterns in the paint (“Now”), small talk in the bedroom hall (“My Only Offer”) and red colonial houses on snow-white streets (pretty much the rest of the album). Mates of State may have begun a decade prior as something of a curiosity—plainsfolk from Lawrence, Kan., singing idiosyncratic love songs with Hammond organs where the guitars should've been—but they evolved into something far greater: pure pop for adults who haven't quite grasped that they're adults yet. The rhythms still shift unpredictably, often throwing down from third to fifth gear within a single track (“You Are Free” starts out bossa nova, then swiftly graduates to bottom-heavy swing at the coda)—but they've become easier on the ears. Think of Re-Arrange Us as the antidote to Richard and Linda Thompson's Shoot Out the Lights: an album about the undying perpetuity of love. —Corey DuBrowa Without a doubt, 2008 hip-hop belonged to Dwayne Carter. After giving away countless songs for free leading up to the release of Tha Carter III, Lil Wayne proved that his saturation plan was effective, selling a million copies in a week. Fitting, as it felt like the album's “A Milli” found that many freestyle versions from Wayne's peers as well. “I don't rap, I sell movies,” he spits on “Playing with Fire.” But if Lil Wayne was a movie, he'd be Richard Pryor's Live at the Sunset Strip. Unlike Jay-Z's recent American Gangster, he doesn't portray a character whose adventures add up to a plot full of triumph and tragedy. Instead, Weezy freestyles about life like a smoked-out dude on the corner, and all sorts of crazy opinions tumble out of his mouth. He ridicules the Rev. Al Sharpton on “Dontgetit,” and says, “You're just another Don King with a perm.” He claims to be a Martian on “Phone Home,” and on “Tie My Hands” he riffs on Hurricane Katrina, “I lost everything, but I ain't the only one / First came the hurricane, then the morning sun.” Tha Carter III hearkens to when rap meant rapp: Isaac Hayes talking for days about some girl he broke with, or Bobby Womack signifying while strumming a blues guitar. It's a testament to Lil Wayne's imaginative use of words that he's grown so popular on the strength of what are essentially soliloquies. Most of the songs don't even feature a topic, just a beat and a perfunctory chorus to tie it together. Meanwhile, the production adds to the dank, Southern vibe. Betty Wright sings the chorus on “Playing with Fire,” Kanye West loops a crying soul vocal for “Let the Beat Build,” and Nina Simone's rendition of “Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood” girds “Dontgetit.” Tha Carter III sounds wild and loose, a testament to Lil Wayne's inimitable, iconic voice. —Mosi Reeves Hot Chip's fusion of dancey sounds (rave, house and two-step garage) with more rock-rooted sounds (funk, indie-pop and soul) lies at the end of a long evolutionary chain, where rock and electronic music first battled for supremacy, then gradually fused together, their previously intractable ideological divisions blurring and dissolving. The band's story summarizes rock's gradual embrace of electronic drums and samples; a story about a band that loves molten beats and fey vocals in equal measure, tentatively moving out of the cloistered bedroom and onto the dance floor (without, in reality, leaving the bedroom—ie, the home studio where Hot Chip recorded Made in the Dark). The band's third album was happily unsurprising, adding new depths of energy, color and confidence to Hot Chip's extant sound. I was the band's most rock-centric record, and also the band's most effortlessly propulsive. Its glitchy grooves now cascade, rarely tangling themselves as they once did. Tripping funk reappears on “Hold On,” but Hot Chip has fully embraced the rowdier sounds inherent in its electronic tools. But Hot Chip didn't neglect its soulful meditations here. On Made in the Dark, Hot Chip stopped trying so hard to integrate the dance and bedroom sounds it loves, instead segregating them to eliminate the compromises of the first two albums. —Brian Howe Kristian Matsson is not even close to being the tallest man on earth nor is he a mid-20th century hero. But the Swedish singer/songwriter's debut album as The Tallest Man on Earth is the stuff of folk legends. On Shallow Grave Matsson's wavering, sometimes yodeling, voice is joined by an acoustic guitar and not much else. There isn't a need for an abundance of instruments and production in these intimate recordings though—the intricate guitar picking that embellishes some of the tracks and the lyrical stories have their own gravitational pull. On “This Wind” the phrasing shifts the time-space feel of the music: “You said, 'Damn be this wind it's still movin' on in to the bones and the bed of my soul.'” As the album's title suggests, death permeates the record. On “The Gardener,” it appears literally as the death of the speaker's competitors—he is a gardener because of the graves he's dug: “So now he's buried by the daisies, so I could stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe,” Mattson sings. The hesitancy in Mattson's vocals and vulnerability of lyrics like, “When we're covered by the thunder we'd become just one and feel the lightning shard,” from “The Sparrow and the Medicine” invite the listeners into the intimate space of the record. —Anna Haas The cover of Okkervil River's 2007 album The Stage Names featured a hand waving outstretched toward an embroidered, sunburst sky, basking in the glow of celebrity exposure. But the album periscoped into the masks and corroded identities of fame's situation from its post-cinematic preamble to its tailpiece chantey for poet John Berryman. The Stand Ins' cover dives beneath, revealing the skull-headed hand-owner who (as real film-industry stand ins do) supports the performance without getting to see the lights himself. This thorny relationship is conceptualized, schematized, scrutinized and historicized on The Stand Ins through characters like glam-rocker Jobriath and a now-famous actresses' pining ex-boyfriend. And Okkervil River itself performs here with an organic ease that's dramatic without reaching for histrionics, continuing to tattoo its rough folkish flesh with Motown horns (“Starry Stairs”), power-pop overdrive (“Pop Lie”) and chugging New Wave bass (“Lost Coastlines”). The inclusion of three orchestral interludes, along with singer Will Sheff's easing off the words-per-measure count a bit, lend some welcome breathing room to the set. “Lost Coastlines,” the album's first proper song, sets its sights on the band's own struggles. And after Sheff and Jonathan Meiburg wail together “we have lost our way/ but nobody`s gonna say it outright,” the track hits, retracts and then comes back twice as strong—an elegy to what's always being lost, even as an achievement like The Stand Ins is only beginning. —Henry Freedland Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser's Dave Fridmann-produced debut album as MGMT is best-known for its murderer's row of airwave-dominating electro-pop smashes: “Time to Pretend”, “Electric Feel” and “Kids” have endured as millennial anthems, widely embraced by listeners who either connected with the band's cynical, self-aware psychedelia or were having too much fun on the dance floor to pick up on all the existential despair. There's much more to Oracular Spectacular than its singles, of course—the jangling and jaded “Weekend Wars,” the droning mysticism of “4th Dimensional Transition,” the piano-pounding menace that is “The Handshake”—but the greatest trick MGMT ever pulled was smuggling the opening salvo of their artistic mission statement into those breakout hits: “This is our decision to live fast and die young/ We've got the vision, now let's have some fun/ Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?/ Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?” They've been pretending ever since. —Scott Russell In considering the follow-up album from a group with a breakout debut, there is often that natural-but-nagging concern that the first record was a fluke. Gnarls Barkley's sophomore release, The Odd Couple, cemented Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo Green's collaborative voice. Their re-invention of modern soul came across loud, funky and clear, picking up right where they left off. St. Elsewhere (2006) introduced us to Gnarls' unique pairing of Cee Lo's soulful, penetrating lyrical style and Danger's psychedelic sound-forging wizardry. The Odd Couple echoes that format, transporting the listener to a refreshing universe where the old school meets the computer age, where Al Green intermingles with Portishead. But this description is unfair, as Gnarls is completely unique, and The Odd Couple only tightens that singular sound. Danger showcases his love of vast musical styles, layering in everything from trippy choral arrangements, melancholy pop and spaghetti westerns while Cee-Lo continues to explore lyrical questions of loneliness and mortality, punctuating them with his incredible voice. —Matt Price Australia has been stomping the rest of the world at rock 'n' roll for over a decade now, and Eddy Current Suppression Ring are a big reason why. This current wave of antipodean rock owes a lot to three friends who started informally jamming at the record pressing plant they all worked at 15 years ago. They named themselves after an obscure piece of technology that probably keeps some kind of large machine from blowing up and immediately started making some of the most crucially frills-free rock records of the last decade or so. Primary Colours, their second album, is their best, a hook-filled blast of no-nonsense rock that lumbers with a beautiful and intentional gracelessness that still leaves room for surprising nuance. It reveals so much of modern day “garage rock” for the pretentious schtick and fashion-first playacting that it is. —Garrett Martin Charles Darwin hasn't taken this much abuse since the days of William Jennings Bryan. But while creationists fight the theory of evolution in schools, this Rhode Island band attacks the societal applications of “survival of the fittest.” “And who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin,” Ben Knox Miller laments in a lovely, layered falsetto, “The lords of war just profit from decay.” If The Low Anthem's argument is for community and collaboration, Exhibit A is the gorgeous chamber folk this trio of multi-instrumentalists crafted on its third album. Following the path cleared by Nick Drake and Tim Buckley, The Low Anthem is at its best composing songs fit for a hipster orchestra, with Knox's delicate vocals backed by an assortment of quirky instrumentation. After two tracks of quiet intimacy, the band erupts into a pair of foot-stompers, grounding an album that otherwise might get blown away by the slightest breeze. Jack Kerouac-by-way-of-Tom Waits tune “The Horizon is a Beltway” and the roadhouse rumpus “Home I'll Never Be” wouldn't sound out of place on an Avett Brothers' record, and they balance the quieter tracks. Whether soft or loud, these 12 songs are exquisite. —Josh Jackson Frequently making music to test your speakers with, M83 has always been keen on orchestrated drama. With guitars gliding across translucent synth lines, the songs on Saturdays = Youth are big statements rendered in cold neon. The dazzling thing about M83 maestro Anthony Gonzalez's serene, nostalgic and expansive fifth effort is his uncanny success at recapturing the heart-leaping whirl of his generation's '80s touchstones. An admitted John Hughes tribute, “Graveyard Girl” collides Ride and the Cocteau Twins in an Encino arcade while “We Own the Sky” is heady digital shoegaze for a fog-filled ice bar. The clear standout, though, is “Kim & Jessie,” which convincingly recaptures the magic gloss of Tears for Fears with a propulsive undercurrent and an elegant use of space. The best song on the album, it's the key destination in a stunning journey. —Jeff Leven Five years after Will Ferrell's Buddy the Elf stumbled in on Zooey Deschanel's Jovie singing a steamy rendition of the classic Christmas duet “Baby It's Cold Outside,” Deschanel paired her smoky voice with that of alt-folk artist M. Ward for the first time as She & Him. The duo's dreamy, dusty arrangements on their debut Volume One are timeless, and two years later they released the second volume of equally enjoyable standards, followed by a Volume 3 in 2013 and a few lovely Christmas albums. Songs like the vintage-pop ditty “Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?” and the Sinatra-esque “I Thought I Saw Your Face Today” felt like instant classics, and 10 years later they're still beloved by serious folk fans and Deschanel's devoted following alike. Together, Ward and Deschanel know how to make soothing mid-century pop without sounding antiquated in the least. —Ellen Johnson Listening to Lykke Li's debut record Youth Novels is listening to a young artist still developing her sound with no preconceived defined edges. The album incorporates spoken word and opens with Li telling her audience in “Melodies & Desires” to “Follow these instructions, do exactly as I do,” and that “love is the melody now sing it with me.” The short “This Trumpet in My Head” is akin to an interlude track with Li's hushed recitation tying back to spoken-word styling. From the open, percussion-centered “Let It Fall” and “Little Bit” to the straining baby voice on “Time Flies” and the stronger, longing vocals on “Tonight,” Lykke Li refuses to be locked into one sound. Li released her latest album so sad so sexy this year, leaning further into the hip-hop rhythms she's explored before—rapper Aminé even lends his voice to the track “two nights.” —Anna Haas The year 2008 may have been fraught with war, economic recession, poor housing markets and all kinds of bad news, but TV on the Radio sounded more party-ready than ever. With a few notable exceptions scattered across its catalog, the innovative Brooklyn quintet has most often opted for the meditative over the motivational, the somber over the sensational. Not that there's anything wrong with that. TVotR is also frequently gorgeous, triumphant and astounding; Before Dear Science, you just usually didn't want to dance to its music. While the band had wowed with slow(er) jams, it's the up-tempo bangers and funky grooves on Dear Science that truly resonate. The band's third full-length album opens with “Halfway Home,” which is interesting if only because the song is closing-credits epic. Silver-throated frontman Tunde Adebimpe kicks things off with buh-buh-bah-bah-bums before switching to mellifluous verses joined by claps, walls of shoegaze guitars and various percussion, to name just a few of the accompaniments. Layering is the name of the game here. It's a style TVotR has been brandishing for years, and the band is only getting better at it. Elsewhere, “Dancing Choose” (say that out loud if you don't catch the title's wordplay) comes rushing out of the gate, again led by Adebimpe, who—like some madcap preacher with eyes rolling back into his head—chants, “He's a what? He's a what? He's a newspaper man. And he gets his best ideas from a newspaper stand.” Constantly cranked to 11, the song's lyrics can be interpreted as political discontent, only adding to its vitriol. No one really sings or writes lyrics quite like Adebimpe, and even his band's lesser songs sound better when you strip away the music and read his words by themselves. —Austin L. Ray Beach House's otherworldly music is a sly pickpocket of reveries from that delicate time between when your head hits the pillow and you hazily submit to slumber. Although “dream pop” sounds like would what happen if Rainbow Brite got the hankering to rock, it nevertheless became the elected label for the band's muted sound. While the duo of vocalist/keyboardist Victoria Legrand and guitarist/keyboardist Alex Scally wrote their self-titled debut in Baltimore and garnered ill-fitting comparisons to more docile bands such as Slowdive and Galaxie 500, their sophomore record, Devotion, is a child from a different climate. Penned during tours with the likes of the Clientele and Grizzly Bear, the cozy music crawls with MicroKorg synth chords, slide guitars and Legrand's breathy alto. Its dreamy, reverb-soaked songs are the perfect soundtrack for wintertime solitude. —Kasia Galazka Prior to 2008, Sigur Rós had pretty exclusively given sonic expression to the wintry fjords and barren interiors of Iceland—the cold, somber but strangely beautiful landscapes most of us have only seen in pictures. But Med sud is a summer record, full of the joy and playfulness of a warm weekend roadtrip. A little sunshine does the band well. Some of the most exhilarating peaks of the album (whose title translates from Iceland to “With a Buzz in Our Ears We Play Endlessly”) are found in its hushed sonic valleys, especially the anguished opening strains of “Festival.” The first half of the song scrapes away all sonic clutter, featuring a minimalist aria of keyboard swells and lead singer Jónsi Birgisson's falsetto soaring beyond heaven to an even more blissful plateau. On album opener “Gobbledigook,” though, the drumbeat propeled the band to its most joyful rhythmic heights, a pulsating abandon unlike anything they'd released to date. —Josh Jackson 808s and Heartbreak is a masterpiece in simplicity and huge emotions, making every sound and shift impactful. It's Kanye at his most vulnerable and destroyed, trying to find some solace after a relationship has ended. The pinnacle of this comes in “Love Lockdown,” 808s and Heartbreak's biggest single that is iconic of the themes and style of the album. With “Love Lockdown,” it's all about how these little shifts occur and come together. There's the basic TR-808 drum machine heartbreak underneath, as Kanye's distorted voice and basic piano piece go through the first verse before gigantic drums blast in, leading to a conclusion full of animalistic sounds and power. On “Street Lights,” you can almost hear the next wave of hip-hop artists getting inspired for their own work. The gorgeous repetition and hazy sounds are reminiscent of Frank Ocean, Kid Cudi, and Drake, especially considering the introspective tone of the album. —Ross Bonaime After spending 2008 opening for Radiohead and appearing on late-night TV shows, Grizzly Bear was suddenly ubiquitous—even without a new album to promote. But while they were on stage they perfected the material that would comprise their third full-length release, and Veckatimest sounds like the final product of a meticulous and exacting evolutionary process—one that adds depth and color to their swooning chamber pop arrangements, crispness to their intricate rhythms and intensity to their careful performances. Their group mind pulsating in unison, the scrappy quartet are wistfully plaintive on the gorgeously swaying “Two Weeks,” pristinely longing on the spectral “Dory” and haunting on the darkly lunging “I Live With You.” But underneath the orchestral flourishes and children's choirs, beneath even the frequent textural shifts and melodic detours, are a set of melodies that find novel ways to cut straight to the listener every time. —Matt Fink There's a subtle poetry to No Age's very unsubtle pounce. Maybe it's a time and space thing. The LA blast-punk duo has always been known for their relentless dedication to the underground circuit; if there's a co-op floorspace in your city, that's where you were most likely to find them. The second album, Nouns, jingles like a tribute to wide eyes and full hearts. With lo-fi charm with their psychedelic dreams of grandeur, it delivers directly, and passionately, to its disciples. No Age is a band loved enough by the California faithful that their name is still proudly enshrined on top of The Smell, straight-edge, all-ages, and deeply adored DIY icon where their legend begins. Nouns is built for that wonderfully disaffected youth, those brave enough to explore the bare, fringe outskirts of the music industry—vegan, solar-powered, and absolutely pumped with vagabond soul. —Luke Winkie James McMurtry delivered one of the year's best albums (and best live shows too) not because his political songs were so scathing (though “Cheney's Toy” is viciously funny), but because his character portraits were so sharply drawn. His characters—kids in a parking lot, drinkers during a hurricane, a heartbroken veterinarian, an angry daughter, a country drummer—are caught in a pattern of trying their best and fucking up. Their contradictions—our contradictions—are reflected in the music that surges forward on twitchy rhythms and loud guitars but never seems to find a harmonic resolution. McMurtry is able to sustain that tension without releasing it for stanza after stanza until he has conjured up his characters and their surroundings in astonishing detail. —Geoffrey Himes Laura Marling once claimed she had no idea what she was doing until six months after she signed her deal with Virgin. But this apparent ignorance still resulted in a debut album full of folk-pop bliss. Produced by Noah and the Whale frontman and then-boyfriend Charlie Fink, Alas, I Cannot Swim was sonically a simple affair with finger-picking acoustics, sparse percussion and melancholic strings. But this rootsy, timeless approach proved to be the perfect foil for then 17-year-old Marling's quietly affecting tones and poetic observations on adolescent romance. Coincidentally Alas was released just a week after another much bigger-selling lovelorn teenage debut, Adele's 19. But with lines as cynical as “Lover please do not fall to your knees/ it's not like I believe in everlasting love” and tracks based on the poetry of Philip Larkin (“Tap at My Window”), Marling's introductory effort was far more beguiling. —Jon O'Brien Craig Finn has always been one of the most self-aware frontmen in rock 'n' roll. “Our songs are sing-along songs,” he declares on Stay Positive's opener “Constructive Summer,” and a couple verses later he shows instead of tells. “Me and my friends are like,” begins the line, before Finn is joined by backing vocals for “double whiskey, coke, no ice.” It's a moment that begs for a full room's worth of shouting as uniting as “LEONARD BERNSTEIN!” during that REM song about the end of the world. Finn intuitively knows this, tossing off lines just like it throughout Stay Positive. Finn and his Brooklyn-by-way-of-Minneapolis crew build upon the same monstrous guitar riffs, lyrical witticisms and Springsteeny rock chug they've purveyed since day one, upping the stakes with bigger choruses, even more self-referential/clever lyrical nuggets, and an everyman aesthetic grew the band's devoted fanbase. If you like raising beers, pumping fists and yelling out choice phrases, then you'll find Stay Positive nearly flawless. As Finn puts it, “It's a pretty good feelin'/ Yeah, it feels pretty good.” —Austin L. Ray Santigold made a quiet comeback this year with her mixtape of soulful dance pop, I Don't Want: The Gold Fire Sessions, which is a fitting commemoration of her debut album's 10-year anniversary. In 2008, the multifaceted singer (then Santogold) burst onto a variety of scenes: She has never restrained herself to one sound or genre, blending electronic dance, dub, punk and sometimes hip hop on her debut to make one uproariously funky milkshake. Santigold is loud and fun, an exploration of sonic explosions (On “Creator,” Santigold is right on the money when she sings “Tell me no, I say yes, I was chosen/ And I will deliver the explosion”). The album's anchor is pop's rattling tribute to indie rock, “You'll Find A Way,” a driving, upbeat tune revealing surprises around every corner. Santigold's Santigold is music for the blissfully indecisive—she never fully commits to one sound, and that's what keeps us coming back to the album even 10 years later. —Ellen Johnson After demonstrating their rough-around-the-edges charm with a frantic 2007 debut, Frightened Rabbit was just about the last band you would have expected to aspire to arena-sized rock anthems. That they pulled it off while retaining their homespun aesthetic is remarkable, as Midnight Organ Fight startles with its heartfelt directness and sing-along immediacy. The album is singularly focused yet emotionally visceral, refining and sharpening the band's rousing sprawl. The late vocalist/guitarist Scott Hutchison wrote songs that tread the fine line between overwrought emoting and startling self-revelation, his wounded Scottish yelp perfectly suited for the unflinching accounts of joyless sex and religious apostasy. The band used a straightforward palette of dexterous drumming, reverb-heavy electric guitar and homey acoustics. But, on their sophomore release, Frightened Rabbit favored major-key immediacy over melancholy inhibition. It's a familiar template, but few bands do so well making songs built for arenas sound like they also belong in bedrooms. —Matt Fink When a record has not only no bad songs but no bad moments, when basslines bounce like rubber, when drums do more than keep time—when they roll and tumble in hypnotic patterns—and when vocals glide between the mannered crooning of an over-privileged indie boy and the spastic yelping of a shocked dog, well, what are we supposed to do? Not love it? Vampire Weekend is Anglo-Afro fusion on par with Graceland. It sounds like David Byrne fronting Orchestra Baobab. It sounds like The Strokes with a sense of humor. It sounds like indie rock simultaneously gentrifying and miscegenating—despite rumors to the contrary, the neighborhood's getting better, more interesting and more colorful. These days, it ain't just surly white dudes playing shitty guitar for other surly white dudes. Indeed, this cosmopolitan quartet has streamlined ska, post-punk, chamber music and Afropop into a glorious ultramodern groove. —Nick Marino Fleet Foxes constantly calls to mind images of wintry isolation and loneliness: Robin Pecknold seems to be a lonely traveler going through each of the songs' worlds, focused more on nature and the introspection of his own existence that the boundless world around him causes him to contemplate than any interpersonal relationships he might have. What makes the band's debut such a great record is that it's a meditative look at nature and Pecknold's relationship to it, but songs like “White Winter Hymnal” explore how that relationship actually effects his interactions with those around him. He seems obviously lost in the woods, on the outside of the “pack” that he follows; it's a terrific examination of the manifestations that loneliness might take when projected into society at large. —Jeff Pearson Not since a creek drank a cradle in 2002 had anyone so quietly overtaken the indie-music community as Justin Vernon did in 2008 with Bon Iver's For Emma, Forever Ago, when Jagjaguwar gave the album a wide release after Vernon pressed 500 copies himself the year before. This lonesome post-break-up album—with its mythic origin story in a remote Wisconsin cabin—is drenched in the kind of melancholy that feels a lot like joy, and sounds just as vivd. Rather than wallowing in loss, Vernon's otherworldly falsetto and warm acoustic guitar provide a hopeful contrast to impressionistic lyrics like “Saw death on a sunny snow.” Vernon's real trick was imbuing such hushed music with so much feeling and such seemingly nonsensical lyrics with such specific meaning to individual listeners. It was less like the end of a relationship and more like the promise of a new beginning. —Josh Jackson",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_200_number-one_albums_of_2017,Billboard 200 number-one albums of 2017,"The highest-selling albums and EPs in the United States are ranked in the Billboard 200, which is published by Billboard magazine. The data are compiled by Nielsen Soundscan based on each album's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as on-demand streaming and digital sales of its individual tracks. In 2017, a total of 38 albums claimed the top position of the chart. Beginning with vocal group Pentatonix's Christmas album, A Pentatonix Christmas, issue dated January 7, another one of which, Canadian singer The Weeknd's third studio album, Starboy returned to the top slot a week later after three weeks from the slot, issue dated December 17, 2016. Taylor Swift's Reputation was the best selling album of 2017. Singer Ed Sheeran's ÷ is the second best-selling album with 451,000 album-equivalent units, of which 322,000 were pure album sales. Rapper Kendrick Lamar's fourth studio album, Damn, went on to become the third best-seller with 603,000 album-equivalent units in its first week of release (353,000 in pure album sales). In the meantime, another Canadian artist Drake's ""playlist"", More Life, which broke many streaming records, sustained 505,000 album-equivalent units, of which 226,000 were pure sales. As of September 2017, the album has moved over 1,864,000 album-equivalent units in the United States, of which 352,000 were pure sales. Rapper Future also made Billboard history releasing two different albums in a week apart: his fifth self-titled album and sixth follow-up, Hndrxx. Both managed to peak atop the chart. Aside from A Pentatonix Christmas, Starboy, ÷, More Life, Damn and Reputation, the only two number-ones with extended chart runs include: Grateful by DJ Khaled and 4:44 by Jay-Z.

https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/the-deadliest-storms-in-us-history,Top 10 Deadliest Hurricanes in US History,"Hurricanes over the years have made landfall in the US, causing billions of dollars in damage, triggering massive evacuations and leaving devastated cities to rebuild. In the most dire of cases, hurricanes have also claimed thousands of lives. Hurricane Harvey first slammed southeast Texas on Aug. 25. The Category 4 hurricane, was eventually downgraded to a tropical storm and turned toward southwest Louisiana, has left at least 30 dead as of Aug. 30, according to officials. The storm brought record flooding, and is regarded as one of the most powerful to hit the nation in a decade. But Harvey was far from the deadliest to strike the US, according to data from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center, which tracked the effects of the catastrophic natural disasters. Here's a look at the worst hurricanes in US history based on reported death toll estimates:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate,Causes of death by rate,"The following is a list of the causes of human deaths worldwide for the year 2002, arranged by their associated mortality rates. There were 57,029,000 deaths tabulated for that year. Some causes listed include deaths also included in more specific subordinate causes (as indicated by the ""Group"" column), and some causes are omitted, so the percentages do not sum to 100. According to the World Health Organization, about 58 million people died in 2005, using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 52.77 million people died in 2010. The causes listed are relatively immediate medical causes, but the ultimate cause of death might be described differently.  For example, tobacco smoking can cause lung disease or cancer, and alcohol abuse can cause liver failure or a motor vehicle accident.  For statistics on preventable ultimate causes see Preventable causes of death. By frequency The table below uses data from 2002 and is out of date. Data is now available for 2015. Note: Tinted backgrounds indicate items that also appear in the subsequent table.  Percentage figures add to more than 100% because some deaths appear in both broadly-defined and narrowly defined categories; for example, Cardiovascular Deaths includes deaths from both Ischaemic Heart Disease and Stroke. Malnutrition Malnutrition can be identified as an underlying cause for shortened life. 70% of childhood deaths (age 0-4) are reportedly due to diarrheal illness, acute respiratory infection, malaria and immunizable disease. However 56% of these childhood deaths can be attributed to the effects of malnutrition as an underlying cause. The effects of malnutrition include increased susceptibility to infection, musculature wasting, skeletal deformities and neurologic development delays. According to the World Health Organization, malnutrition is named as the biggest contributor to child mortality with 36 million deaths in 2005 related to malnutrition. Developed vs. developing economies Top causes of death, according to the World Health Organization report for the calendar year 2001: By age group By occupation With an average of 123.6 deaths per

We're going to tell you about a horse called Constantinople, which many good judges believe will win the 2019 Lexus Melbourne Cup. Why will it win? Because it's basically the same style of horse as the 2017 and 2018 winners, that's why. READ MORE: The Fun 2019 Melbourne Cup Form Guide For People Who Know Nothing About Racing Allow us to explain. Different types of horses win the Melbourne Cup in different eras. In the old days, you just needed a horse that could ""stay"" -- which is racing speak for a horse than can last the gruelling 3200m distance of the Melbourne Cup. In the 1990s, a different style of horse started winning. Horses like Let's Elope (1991) and Saintly (1996) and Might and Power (1997) could stay, but they also had a breathtaking turn of acceleration. So speed became as important as stamina. The 1990s was a landmark decade in the evolution of the Melbourne Cup for another reason. This, of course, was when the first northern hemisphere raider won the Cup (Vintage Crop in 1993). The foreigners have come every year since then. In the early days, most of them were seasoned champions in their own countries, with 20 or 30 or 40 races under their belt. Then in 2014, things changed again. They started sending younger horses with potential. 2014 was a good year for Germany. First they won the FIFA World Cup. Then they sent a horse called Protectionist to the Melbourne Cup. It won, at just its 10th race start. In 2017, a lightly raced, lightly weighted European four-year-old called Rekindling won the Cup, also at its 10th start. In 2018, a lightly raced, lightly weighted European four-year-old called Cross Counter won it, at just its eighth start. See the trend? Young fit European raiders. These are the horses winning Melbourne Cups right now, and Constantinople is the one that ticks all the boxes in 2019. ""You couldn't help but be impressed with what Constantinople did in the Caulfield Cup,"" TAB racing expert Gerard Daffy told 10 daily. He's right. Constantinople was dragged backed through the field approaching the home turn, and was close enough to last as the field entered the straight. It tried to go through a gap. The gap closed. By the time it finally wound up to full speed, the race was over, but jockey Luke Nolen had still managed to steer Constantinople into a very unlucky fourth place. ""There are certain things you have to ask about a Melbourne Cup chance,"" Daffy said. ""Will the horse stay? Can its trainer train stayers? Is it in form? Does it have a good rider?"" Yes, yes, yes and yes to Gerard's key criteria: Constantinople has had nine starts in its career, and has consistently runs well over longer distances (though admittedly it has never run or won over the Melbourne Cup distance) Formerly trained in Europe, it is now in the stable of David Hayes, who won a Melbourne Cup with Jeune in 1994. Its Caulfield Cup run showed it's in form. The jockey in the Melbourne Cup will be João Mereira, the Hong-Kong based champion Brazilian jockey who rode Heartbreak City to second in the 2016 Melbourne Cup. One more thing you should know about Constantinople, barring unforeseen events. It's going to start the Lexus Melbourne Cup as one of the favourites second favourite. But here's the good news. In your average horse race, favourites are about $3, which means you triple your money. Constantinople is currently the $9.50 third favourite with TAB, behind Japanese horse Mer De Glace -- which won the Caulfield Cup. It was actually favourite late last week at $7, but a flood of money for Mer De Glace saw its odds tumble in to from $8 to $6.50, before it drifted back out to $9. Meanwhile Finche -- trained by Winx's trainer Chris Waller -- has firmed in the market and is the $8 favourite as of 9 am Tuesday morning. This could still change. READ MORE: Which Melbourne Cup Horses Can Handle The Wet Track? But for now, we think $9.50 is a really good price. We're not encouraging you to back Constantinople, and indeed, there are other horses who fit the criteria of being a lightly raced European. But this reporter knows where some of his money is going. Plus a few sneaky dollars each-way on Southern France, which is another lightly-raced European now trained here in Australia by Ciaron Maher.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_monarchies,Current monarchies,"This is a list of current  monarchies. As of 2019, there are 44 sovereign states in the world with a monarch as Head of state. 13 in Asia, 12 in Europe, 10 in North America, 6 in Oceania and 3 in Africa. Types of monarchy These are roughly the categories which modern monarchies fall into: Commonwealth realms. Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch of sixteen Commonwealth realms (Antigua and Barbuda; the Commonwealth of Australia; the Commonwealth of the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Canada; Grenada; Jamaica; New Zealand; the Independent State of Papua New Guinea; the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Solomon Islands; Tuvalu; and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). They evolved out of the British Empire into fully independent states within the Commonwealth of Nations that retain the Queen as head of state, unlike other Commonwealth countries that are either dependencies, republics or have a different royal house. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies, where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role. Other European constitutional monarchies. The Principality of Andorra; the Kingdom of Belgium; the Kingdom of Denmark; the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; the Kingdom of the Netherlands; the Kingdom of Norway; the Kingdom of Spain; and the Kingdom of Sweden are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role. Andorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is a diarchy, with the Co-Princeship being shared by the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell. This arrangement creates a unique situation among monarchies, as a) neither Co-Prince is of Andorran descent, b) one is elected by common citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French Presidential Elections, c) the other, the bishop of Urgell, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the Pope. European mixed monarchies. Liechtenstein and Monaco are constitutional monarchies in which the Prince retains many powers of an absolute monarch. For example, the 2003 Constitution referendum gives the Prince of Liechtenstein the power to veto any law that the Landtag (parliament) proposes and vice versa. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post. However, unlike an absolute monarch, the people can call for a referendum to end the Prince's reign. The Prince of Monaco has simpler powers: he cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can select the minister of state, government council and judges. Muslim monarchies. These Muslim monarchs of the Kingdom of Bahrain; the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace; the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; the State of Kuwait; the Kingdom of Morocco; the Sultanate of Oman; the State of Qatar; the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and the United Arab Emirates generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts. Absolute monarchs remain in the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace; the Sultanate of Oman; the State of Qatar; the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and the United Arab Emirates. while the Kingdom of Bahrain and the State of Kuwait are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Malaysia, and the Kingdom of Morocco are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than in European equivalents. East and Southeast Asian constitutional monarchies. The Kingdom of Bhutan; the Kingdom of Cambodia; and the Kingdom of Thailand have constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or ceremonial role. Thailand changed from traditional absolute monarchy into a constitutional one during the twentieth century, while the Kingdom of Bhutan changed in 2008. The Kingdom of Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the French Colonial Empire, which was deposed after the Khmer Rouge came into power. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993. The State of Japan has no official head of state under the 1947 constitution, but is commonly considered a de facto constitutional monarchy. Other monarchies. Five monarchies do not fit into one of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the Kingdom of Tonga in Polynesia; Kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland) and the Kingdom of Lesotho in Africa; and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (S.M.O.M.), and the Vatican City State in Europe. Of these, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Vatican City State are absolute monarchies. The Kingdom of Eswatini is increasingly being considered a diarchy. The King, or Ngwenyama, rules alongside his mother, the Ndlovukati, as dual heads of state originally designed to be checks on political power. The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which has become largely symbolic in recent years.  S.M.O.M. is governed by an elected Prince and Grand Master.  The Pope is the absolute monarch of the Vatican by virtue of his position as head of the Roman Catholic Church and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than hereditary ruler. The Pope need not be a citizen of the territory prior to his election by the cardinals. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not officially a monarchy, but as of 2013 its constitution requires a member of the Kim family to rule the country, and so some consider it to be a de facto absolute monarchy. Lines of succession Some of the extant sovereign monarchies have lines of succession that go back to the medieval period or antiquity:   The kings of Cambodia claim descent from Queen Soma (1st century), although the historiographical record is interrupted in the ""Dark ages of Cambodia"" (15th/16th centuries). The monarchy in Cambodia was abolished between 1970 and 1993. There exists several suggestions to a possible line of succession in the Danish monarchy from the late 7th century and until Gorm the Old, but none of these suggestions have so far won universal acceptance. Most monarchs in Denmark since the 940s have been descendants of Gorm the Old's father Harthacnut and all monarchs in Denmark since 1047 have been descendants of titular Queen Estrid Svendsdatter. A formal law of succession was not adapted in Denmark until 1665. Japan, considered a constitutional monarchy under the Imperial House of Japan, has a claim to being the world's oldest extant continuous hereditary monarchy, with a traditional origin in 660 BC, commonly accepted archaeological and cultural evidence from the 3rd century and reliable historiographical evidence from at least the 6th century. The monarchs of the kingdom of Norway by virtue of descent from Harald I Fairhair, who united the realm in 872. Harald as a member of the House of Yngling is given a partly legendary line of succession from earlier petty kings in historiographical tradition. Far from all monarchs of Norway since the 930s have been descendants of Harald Fairhair (at least 7 or 8 Norwegian kings from the period c. 970 – 1859 weren't descendants of Harald Fairhair). The kings of Spain via descent from the Catholic Monarchs (via the House of Habsburg), ultimately combining the lines of succession of Castile and León and Aragon, realms established in the  10th to 11th centuries in the course of the Reconquista, via the Kingdom of Asturias claiming descent from the Visigothic Kingdom (which, originally ruled by the Thervingi kings, had become elective in the 6th century). The monarchy of Spain was abolished twice in the 19th & 20th centuries (1873-1874 and 1931-1947) and replaced by republics. The monarchs of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms inherit the throne by virtue of the line of descent from the House of Stuart (Union of the Crowns 1603), combining the lines of succession of the kingdoms of England and Scotland going back to the 9th century. The succession to the English throne can be argued to originate with the House of Wessex, established in the 6th century; that to the Scottish throne with descent from Pictish kings which likewise enter the historical record around the 6th century. The line of succession and descent of the Scottish throne are unbroken, whereas the English throne shifted between several unrelated dynasties/families between 1013 and 1066. The monarchy of England was abolished in 1649 and that of Scotland in 1652 and replaced by various types of republican governments between the years 1649 to 1660. Current monarchies Footnote Belgium is the only existing popular monarchy – a system in which the monarch's title is linked to the people rather than a state. The title of Belgian kings is not King of Belgium, but instead King of the Belgians. Another unique feature of the Belgian system is that the new monarch does not automatically assume the throne at the death or abdication of his predecessor; he only becomes monarch upon taking a constitutional oath.

The inaugural African Powers of Consumer Products report, which examined the Top 50 Consumer Product (CP) companies on the continent, based on publicly available data from 15 African stock exchanges, found that South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Morocco account for 64% of the top companies. The food sub-sector accounted for 64% of the top 50 followed by beverages at 28%. As many as 23 companies in the top 50 are based in Southern Africa, 18 in North Africa, six in West Africa and three in East Africa. The average revenues of of the top 50 companies on the list amounted to US$605 million, versus S$1.5 billion for the average top 10 company. The largest company, Tiger Brands, heads up the list with a revenue of US$2.6 billion in the reported period which included the financial year ending May 2016. Top 10 companies by revenue in US$ The South African companies in the Top 10 have a more widespread geographic footprint compared to their Nigerian counterparts, whose operations and investments are restricted to their domestic market. On average, the South African companies have manufacturing facilities or other investments in four countries. Tiger Brands has the largest manufacturing and investment footprint, with a presence in six African (and two Latin American) countries, Deloitte said. Top 10 fastest-growing by revenue in reporting currency The consumer product industry in Africa experienced a challenging year in FY15. Only 14 out of the Top 50 CP companies recorded positive year-on-year revenue growth measured in US dollar terms, although 39 recorded positive growth in their local currency.

https://newrepublic.com/article/120157/republicans-harvard-how-gop-learned-love-ivies,How Republicans Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Ivy League,"A major theme in the modern conservative movement has been its attack on elites, university elites in particular. William Buckley famously remarked that he would “rather entrust the government of the United States to the first 400 people listed in the Boston telephone directory than to the faculty of Harvard University.” When Ronald Reagan was first elected governor of California, one of his major campaign themes was to “clean up the mess at Berkeley.” George W. Bush decried the “intellectual arrogance” of his undergraduate alma mater, Yale University. More recently, conservative activists like David Horowitz wrote a book called the 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America But Tuesday's election hinted that the relationship between conservatives and elite universities might be changing. Congress is now home to a group of Republicans who not only went to Ivy League Schools but also flaunted this credential during their campaigns. In upstate New York, Elise Stefanik became the youngest woman elected to Congress after running ads that noted she “graduated from Harvard University.” Tom Cotton won a Senate seat in Arkansas after flogging his Harvard degrees so much that his opponent complained he had “used Harvard to further his political career.” Ben Sasse—a graduate of Harvard with a Ph.D. from Yale and the author of a TEDx talk on higher education in the past year—won a Senate seat in Nebraska. America's universities became more politically liberal in the decades after World War II, culminating in the liberal 1960's. Conservatives initially responded in the 1970s and 1980s by creating an alternative university structure for those on the political right—not only to educate students but also to network them into power. Jerry Falwell created Liberty University in 1971 and Pat Robertson created Regent University in 1978. When George W. Bush became president, he filled many important positions in his administration with Liberty and Regent graduates. But Republicans did not withdraw from elite universities entirely. In fact, they were trying to carve out their own spaces within them. Centers like the Hoover Institution at Stanford University remained major hubs of conservative thought, particularly on economic policy. The Federalist Society was founded in 1982 at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Chicago Law School, and helped launch the modern conservative legal movement. Slowly, elite universities became more conservative—even if in relatively small numbers. These schools started to realize that conservative perspectives needed to be represented in higher education. As Alan Brinkley, a former provost at Columbia, once wrote: “[I]t would be hard to argue that the American Right has received anything like the amount of attention from historians that its role in twentieth-century politics and culture suggests it should.” Law schools hired scholars who argued that the Constitution should be interpreted according to what it meant at the time it was drafted, a position that the Republican Party has embraced. Economics departments, which tend to be relatively conservative, rose in prominence in universities. This year, these iterative changes on elite university campuses might have finally percolated into our national elections. The Republican Party has embraced its new crop of proud Harvard alumni. Stefanik was the subject of a story the week before the election by The New York Times labeling her a “rising star in Republican circles.” Tom Cotton has been labeled a “conservative superstar.” Glenn Beck proudly featured Sasse on his show several times. Many Republicans now see an Ivy League education as a signal of sincere conviction. These politicians' beliefs are battle worn from their time at university campuses dominated by unsympathetic liberals. One supporter of Sasse noted that the candidate had never been influenced by the “group think of those liberal institutions” he attended. Ivy League degrees also signal a politician's transformative abilities. Vote for me, the Republican argument goes, because I have helped transform these elite universities from liberal ivory towers to places where conservatives can thrive. An essay in The Wall Street Journal endorsed Cotton by noting that he could “redeem Harvard.” The essay notes that Cotton fought against orthodoxies at Harvard by writing conservative columns for the student newspapers. After graduating from Harvard Law School, this essay argues, he fought back against campus orthodoxies by joining the military despite the anti-military attitudes on the Harvard campus. Why the change? It might just be that Republicans are sick of having their candidates labeled as less intelligent and less qualified. In the past, Democrats sometimes pointed to their university affiliations to legitimate themselves and cast Republicans like Michele Bachmann or (going farther back) Reagan as unintelligent and unqualified for power. No one will or can criticize the intelligence of Stefanik, Cotton, or Sasse because of their educational backgrounds. An Ivy League education comes with other perks for any ambitious person. Stefanik, Cotton, and Sasse's educations helped them obtain important positions in the public and private sectors and accelerated their path to public office. All three are young—Stefanik is 30, Cotton is 37, and Sasse is 42—and could be major players in conservative politics for decades to come. Stefanik and Cotton also both turned to Harvard alumni for major financial contributions. When Cotton was attacked for the work that he did at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, he was publicly supported by his Ivy-League educated colleagues. To be sure, large swaths of the Republican Party are still hostile toward elite universities. As The Atlantic Monthly and The New York Times reported, Tea Party supporters at the core of the Republican Party are still wary of Ivy League degrees. Republicans in Congress have also tried to cut funding for the National Science Foundation, which provides $7 billion annually to fund research—particularly research at universities. Republicans rail against the climate change science produced in universities. Still, such attacks will lose their edge if Republicans continue to elect proud graduates of the very places they attack. The party has a long way to go in overcoming its anti-elitist reputation. If that does change, though, we could look back to Tuesday's election as an early moment when that started to happen.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_net_worth,Presidents of the United States by net worth,"The peak wealth of presidents of the United States has varied considerably. Debt and depreciation often meant that presidents had negative net worth when they died. Most presidents before 1845 were extremely wealthy, including Andrew Jackson, who was born into poverty, and George Washington. Many of these early presidents were landowners, and some of them owned plantations, including slaves. 	  Presidents since 1929, when Herbert Hoover took office, have generally been wealthier than before; all except Harry S. Truman were millionaires. These presidents have often received income from autobiographies and other writing; other than John F. Kennedy (who died in office in 1963), all presidents beginning with Calvin Coolidge have written autobiographies. In addition, many presidents, including Bill Clinton, had considerable income from public speaking after leaving office. The richest president in history is Donald Trump, who is the first billionaire president. His net worth, however, is not known precisely because The Trump Organization is privately held. By estimate, Trump is wealthier than all former presidents combined. Harry S. Truman was the poorest president, with a net worth considerably less than $1 million. The presidential pension was created in 1958, when former President Harry Truman was experiencing financial trouble. His financial state contributed to the doubling of the presidential salary to $100,000 in 1949. Harry S and Bess Truman received the first Medicare Cards in 1966 via the Social Security Act of 1965.

The decision was taken at the 42nd session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO at Manama in Bahrain on Saturday. As recommended by the World Heritage Committee, India accepted the renaming of the ensemble as “Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai” Rajabai Clock Tower as part of the Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensemble of Mumbai. India has been successful in securing the inscription of the ""Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai” on UNESCO's World Heritage List under Criteria (ii) and (iv) as defined in the UNESCO's Operational Guidelines. This makes Mumbai city the second city in India after Ahmedabad to be inscribed on the World Heritage List. In the past 5 years alone, India has managed to get inscribed seven of its properties/sites on the World Heritage List of UNESCO. India now has overall 37 World Heritage Inscriptions with 29 Cultural, 07 Natural and 01 Mixed sites. While India stands second largest in number after China in terms of number of World Heritage properties in ASPAC (Asia and Pacific) region, it is overall sixth in the world. On this historic moment, the Union minister of state for culture Mahesh Sharma has congratulated the residents of Mumbai and the entire country for this landmark achievement. In his statement, the minister said that the international recognition to the heritage precinct of the city of Mumbai is a matter of great pride to the nation and it will boost the local economy in a number of ways. He also added that this achievement is expected to give a tremendous fillip to domestic and international tourism leading to increased employment generation, creation of world-class infrastructure and augmentation of sale of local handicrafts, handlooms and heritage memorabilia.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_wooden_buildings,Tallest wooden buildings,"Several wooden skyscraper designs have been designed and built, with the tallest currently being the Sanctuary of Truth, a 105-meter high temple in Pattaya, Thailand.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/11-most-powerful-militaries-in-the-world-2014-4,The 11 most powerful militaries in the world,"Asymmetrical wars in Afghanistan, Vietnam, and now in Syria demonstrate all too clearly that relatively small numbers of belligerents can carry out successful military operations against superior forces. But still, firepower is extremely important. A country's projection of power relies in large part upon its military capabilities. Successfully being able to project and wield that power is a key diplomatic asset. The website Global Firepower ranks the most powerful militaries in the world based on multiple factors, including available manpower, total labour force, and access to strategic assets. Nuclear capabilities are not included in the calculation. Below are the 11 most powerful militaries in the world according to the 2014 rankings (click country names to see military assets data). The US defence budget is $US612 billion. Despite sequestration and other spending cuts, the United States spends more money on defence than the next ten highest spending countries combined. America's biggest conventional military advantage is its fleet of 19 aircraft carriers, compared to 12 carriers operated by the rest of the world combined. These massive carriers allow the US to set up forward operating bases anywhere and project power throughout the world. The super power also has by far the most aircraft of any country, cutting-edge technology like the Navy's new rail gun, a large and well-trained human force — and that's not even counting the world's largest nuclear arsenal. Two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's military is growing again. The Kremlin's military spending has increased by almost a third since 2008 and is expected to grow 44% more in the next three years. Today, the Russian defence budget stands at $US76.6 billion. Russia currently has 766,000 active frontline personnel with a reserve force of 2,485,000 personnel. These troops are backed up by 15,500 tanks, the largest tank force in the world. Russian soldiers generally receive relatively mediocre training, however, and their equipment, like that tank force, is ageing. China has embarked upon a relentless policy of massive military spending, with a 12.2% increase in spending over the past year. China's defence budget stands at $US126 billion but could unofficially be higher, prompting concern across Asia as China attempts to project its power to settle border disputes with Japan and the Philippines. The size of the Chinese army is staggering, with 2,285,000 active frontline personnel with an additional 2,300,000 in the reserves. China also has a history of successfully stealing sensitive military technology, such as recently acquiring sensitive information about the new F-35. India's defence spending is expected to rise as it pursues a modernization drive. Currently, it is estimated that India only spends $US46 billion on its budget, and it is slated to become the fourth highest spender by 2020. It is already the world's largest importer of military goods. India has ballistic missiles with a range capable of hitting all of Pakistan or most of China. Indian military strategy has been dominated by its long-simmering conflict with Pakistan, although there have also been minor wars between China and India in the past. The UK is planning on reducing the size of its armed forces by 20% between 2010 and 2018, with smaller cuts to the Royal Navy and RAF. The defence budget stands at $US54 billion. Despite scaling back, the UK counts on being able to project its power around the world. The Royal Navy is planning on putting the HMS Queen Elizabeth, an aircraft carrier that has a flight deck measuring at 4.5 acres, into service in 2020. The Queen Elizabeth is planned to carry 40 F-35B joint strike fighters around the world. Thanks to superior training and equipment, Britain could still hold an advantage over emerging powers like China, according to a leading think tank. France effectively froze its military spending in 2013 while cutting 10% of its defence jobs in an effort to save money for purchasing high-tech equipment. The country spends $US43 billion a year on defence, which is 1.9% of its GDP, below the spending target set by NATO for member countries. Despite a levelling off of its military budget, France is still highly capable of projecting force around the globe, with significant deployments in the Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Senegal and elsewhere around the world. German military strength falls short of its economic strength on the world stage. Recently, Germany has started considering offering military support to eastern European NATO members. It has also considered a more active international role militarily. Germany spends $US45 billion on its military annually, making it the eighth largest spender in the world. Following the aftermath of World War II, the German population generally became anti-war. The German military was originally limited to a defence force, but has become more accustomed to taking an active international role following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Germany only has 183,000 active frontline personnel with an additional 145,000 members in the reserves. Germany eliminated mandatory service in 2011 in an attempt to create a professional army. Turkish military spending is expected to rise 9.4% in 2014 over the 2013 budget. The ongoing conflict in Syria and possible clashes with the Kurdish separatist organisation, the PKK, were key reasons for the spending increase. Turkey's defence budget stands at $US18.2 billion. The NATO member has contributed soldiers to various initiatives around the world. The Turkish military took part in operations in Afghanistan, as well as in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. Turkey also maintains a large military force in Northern Cyprus. South Korea has been increasing its defence spending due to both the increasing armament of Japan and China, and the constant threat from North Korea. South Korea spends $US34 billion on defence. South Korea has a relatively large military force for its small size. It has 640,000 active personnel with an additional 2,900,000 personnel in the reserves. South Korea also has 2,346 tanks and 1,393 aircraft. The South Korean military is generally well-trained and routinely takes part in military exercise with the United States. South Korea's air force is also the sixth largest in the world. Japan increased its defence spending for the first time in 11 years in response to growing disputes with China. It has also started its first military expansion in over 40 years by placing a new military base on its outer islands. Japan spends $US49.1 billion on defence, the sixth most in the world. Japan's military is fairly well-equipped. It currently has 247,000 active personnel with an additional 57,900 in reserve. Japan also has 1,595 aircraft, the world's fifth largest air force, and 131 ships. Japan's military is limited by a peace clause in the constitution that makes it illegal for the country to have an offensive army. Israel spends significantly more than its neighbours proportionally for defence. In 2009, Israel spent 18.7% of its national budget on defence. Israel's defence budget stands at $US15 billion. A large percentage of the Israeli defence budget goes toward defence technology. One of the best examples of this is Israel's Iron Dome, a missile defence shield that can intercept rockets shot into Israel from the Palestinian territories. Israel aims to replace Iron Dome with a laser defence shield called Iron Beam.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate,Countries by firearm-related death rate,"This is a historical list of countries by firearm-related death rate per 100,000 population in the listed year.

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/28/heres-how-the-trump-rally-stacks-up-against-other-presidents.html,Here's how the Trump rally stacks up against other presidents,"After President Donald Trump's election in November, investors bet big that the new president would be good for the stock market, sparking one of the strongest post-election rallies in decades. But the “Trump bump” has stalled a bit as the new administration wraps up a rocky first 100 days. Still, over the past six decades, stock-market rallies in the early days of a change of administration aren't necessarily a great predictor of investor returns over the full term of the incoming president. The stock market's jubilant response to Trump's election was initially compared to the reaction to Ronald Reagan's 1980 defeat of Jimmy Carter. Both Trump and Reagan campaigned on a platform that promised sweeping deregulation, a prospect that investors assume will help companies boost profits. Reagan's post-election rally fizzled within weeks, though, thanks to an aggressive series of interest-rate hikes in late 1980 aimed at snuffing out double-digit inflation. Between Election Day and the end of the year, short-term rates surged from 14 percent to just more than 20 percent. Stock investors were ultimately rewarded by the Reagan administration, which followed through on its promises with major deregulation of industries such as telecommunications, among others. But those returns were sharply curtailed by the crash of 1987, which wiped out more than 25 percent of the market's value in a week. The biggest market rally for a change in administration followed the swearing-in of Lyndon Johnson after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, which sparked a sharp sell-off. Within weeks, the market had recovered and continued to move higher. The Kennedy administration had gotten off to a strong start. In the first 100 days after the inauguration in January 1961, stocks jumped by 18.5 percent as the US economy shook off the economic drag from a recession that ended a month after Kennedy took office. President Barack Obama had the worst first 100 days of any postwar president, as the stock market and the economy were in the throes of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. His predecessor, George W. Bush, also had a rocky start to his first term, after taking office in the middle of a major bear market sparked by the unwinding of the 2000s tech bubble. That bubble helped Bill Clinton chalk up the best stock-market performance of the last 11 presidents. During his eight years in office, the S&P 500 index soared from 433 to 1,343, a gain of more than 200 percent. Obama turned in the second-best stock-market performance, despite the financial crisis that was raging at the start of his presidency. The market lost another 15 percent during his first two months in office before bottoming out. As of Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 181 percent since he was first inaugurated in January 2009. The financial crisis left his predecessor with the worst stock market record of the last 11 presidents. The second Bush administration was briefly in positive territory during the second term, but those gains were more than wiped out by the crisis of 2008.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_mergers_and_acquisitions,Largest mergers and acquisitions,"The following tables list the largest mergers and acquisitions in each decade.

https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2017-every-native-4k-ps4-pro-game-tested,Digital Foundry: Every PS4 Pro native 4K game tested,"If you've bought PlayStation 4 Pro and paired it with a brand new ultra HD TV, the chances are that you'll be looking for a range of games designed to get the most out of both of your new purchases. As we stated in our Christmas videocast, the likes of Ratchet and Clank, Rise of the Tomb Raider and COD Infinite Warfare are must-play experiences, but just how many PS4 Pro titles manage to hit a native 4K with full-fat 60fps gameplay? There's no shortage of 4K games lists for PS4 Pro dotted across the internet, so over the last few weeks we spent our spare time getting hold of each and every game that purports to offer native ultra HD gaming, with an emphasis on targeting 60fps. Each title was put under the Digital Foundry microscope, with pixel-counts carried out to ensure that native resolution was indeed being delivered. Curiously, we discovered that quite a few titles said to be running at 4K were clearly and obviously not handing in anything like the required pixel-count, so we created a sub-category for these titles along with their actual native rendering resolutions. In the final analysis, we were left with a mere ten titles that fulfilled the initial brief - handing in the combination of a locked 4K pixel count matched with 60fps gameplay. You can watch Dave Bierton and Tom Morgan sort the wheat from the chaff in the latest Digital Foundry videocast below, where the discussion is backed with native 4K footage for all titles captured. Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video. For those that like to have the data broken down for them, based on our testing, we count ten pure, native 4K 60fps titles available right now for PlayStation 4 Pro: Still handing in an impressive 4K 60fps experience, but just falling short in a couple of areas, we have: We recognise that 60fps isn't a prime requisite for gaming, and there are a bunch of native 4K titles out there running at 30fps too. We've still got a couple to test here (Parappa the Rapper's demo is 4K30, for example, but we'll wait for the final game) but right now the list is as follows: And finally, we have titles widely reported online to be operating at native 4K, but actually running sub-natively, or using other upscaling techniques like checkerboarding. Of course, gaming resolution isn't the be-all and end-all of the gameplay experience. Many Pro titles still look phenomenal on ultra HD screens without having to hit anything like native resolution. Even 1440p titles - of which they are many on PS4 Pro - can still offer a big visual upgrade over the existing 1080p versions on base PlayStation hardware.

The first title in the series, the eponymous Final Fantasy, premiered in Japan in 1987, and Final Fantasy games have been released almost every single year since. Fifteen games have been released as part of the main (numbered) series. Sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and related video games have been published, as well as numerous titles in other media forms. Each game in the main series takes place in a different fictional universe rather than serve as direct sequels to prior games, although some titles have received sequels, or prequels, set in the same universe. Most of the games have been re-released for several different platforms, many of which have been included in bundled releases. The series as a whole is primarily composed of role-playing video games, but also includes massively multiplayer online role-playing games, third-person shooters, tower defense games, and tactical role-playing games. Final Fantasy games have been released on over a dozen video game consoles beginning with the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as for personal computers and mobile phones. The series is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 100 million units worldwide as of June 2011, across both the main series and its spin-offs. Final Fantasy's popularity has placed it as one of the best-selling video game franchises. Main series Main series-related games Final Fantasy Tactics Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy Final Fantasy XV Universe Spin-offs Note that three games were marketed in North America as The Final Fantasy Legend series, but they were originally created as entries in the SaGa series of games, and are not true Final Fantasy titles. None of the three games bore any Final Fantasy branding in their original Japanese versions.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/whats-going-to-kill-you-2015-10-27,The 10 most likely ways you're going to die,"What are your chances of dying from heart disease, stroke or cancer? According to the World Health Organization, measuring how many people die each year and why they died is one of the most important means — along with gauging how diseases and injuries are affecting people — for assessing the effectiveness of a country's health system. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on deaths in the US in 2013, these are the leading causes of death in America ... Of these, suicides by firearms numbered 21,175. Above, a sign for an emergency phone is seen on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. An estimated 1,300 people are believed to have jumped to their deaths from the bridge since it was opened in 1937. A project is underway to build a mesh suicide barrier under the bridge. It is expected to be complete in 2018. The CDC says that more than 20 million US adults have chronic kidney disease and that most of them are not aware of their condition. About one in three adults with diabetes and one in five adults with high blood pressure has chronic kidney disease. In 1918, an estimated 675,000 Americans died from the Spanish flu. Diabetes can cause serious health complications, including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure and lower-extremity amputations. The Department of Health and Human Services' National Institute on Aging says on its website that although one does not die of Alzheimer's disease, the body's defense mechanisms, during the course of the disease, ultimately weaken, increasing susceptibility to catastrophic infection and other causes of death related to frailty. Above, Story Landis, then the director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, testifies in 2014 before the Senate Committee on Appropriations on the rising cost of Alzheimer's. Besides being the fifth leading cause of death in the US, strokes are a major cause of adult disability, according to the CDC. About 800,000 people in the US suffer a stroke each year. One American dies from a stroke every four minutes, on average. These include nontransport accidents, such as falls (30,208) accidental poisonings (38,851) and transport accidents, the majority of which are motor-vehicle accidents (37,938). Lower respiratory diseases include bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. The most common cancer killers were trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, followed by lymphatic and colorectal cancer. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US among both men and women, killing one in four people. The CDC says that coronary heart disease, caused by plaque buildup in the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, is the most common type of heart disease, killing more than 370,000 people annually.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims,Serial killers by number of victims,"A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people, in two or more separate events over a period of time, for primarily psychological reasons. There are gaps of time between the killings, which may range from a few days to months, or many years. This list shows serial killers from the 20th century to present day by number of victims. In many cases, the exact number of victims assigned to a serial killer is not known, and even if that person is convicted of a few, there can be the possibility that they killed many more. Organization and ranking of serial killings is made difficult by the complex nature of serial killers and incomplete knowledge of the full extent of many killers' crimes. To address this, multiple categories have been provided in order to more accurately describe the nature of certain serial murders. This is not a reflection of an individual's overall rank, which may or may not vary depending on personal opinion concerning the nature and circumstances of their crimes. The fourth column in the table states the number of victims definitely assigned to that particular serial killer, and thus the table is in order of that figure. The fifth column states the number of possible victims the killer could have murdered. Some of these crimes are unsolved, but were included because they are the work of a serial killer, despite nobody being caught. This list does not necessarily include war criminals or members of democidal governments, such as Adolf Hitler, Hideki Tojo, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, or Pol Pot. Only serial killers with 10 confirmed or suspected murders should be included on this list. Serial killers with the highest known victim count The most prolific modern serial killer is Harold Shipman, with 218 proven murders and possibly as many as 250 (see ""Medical professionals"", below). Excluding these ""Medical professionals and pseudo-medical professionals"", with their ability to kill simply and in plain sight, and Serial killer groups and couples (below), this list is a compilation of modern serial killers currently with the highest verifiable murder count. Serial killers with 15 to 30 victims This part of the list contains all serial killers with 15 to 30 proven victims who acted alone and were neither medical professionals nor contract killers. Serial killers with 10 to 14 proven victims This part of the list contains all serial killers with less than 15 proven victims who acted alone and were neither medical professionals nor contract killers. Serial killers with fewer than five proven victims This part of the list contains all serial killers with fewer than five proven victims who acted alone and were neither medical professionals nor contract killers.

https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/12/100-most-iconic-cats-in-movies.html,Meow Mix: The 100 Most Iconic Cats in Movies,"When we did our list of the 100 Most Iconic Dogs in Film back in May, this list became inevitable. Yin and Yang. Heads and tails. Dog people, cat people.Though they'd likely pretend to not care a whit—because, you know, cats—what would movies be without the feline persuasion? There'd certainly be a lot fewer jump-scares in horror movies, for one thing. There'd also be a lot less cuteness, menace and elegance. Whether man-eating lion or adorable kitty, cats have occupied important roles in some of our favorite films. Here are 100 of the most iconic movie cats (big and small) of all time. When he decides to launch his superhero career, a newly suited-up Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), finds a lack of people to save. So he begins by trying to find a lost cat in his neighborhood called, hilariously, “Mr. Bitey.” Dave finds the cat on a billboard and—with great effort—climbs up to rescue him. When the cat won't come to him, he yells, “Fuck you, Mr. Bitey,” and then falls to the pavement below—putting him in a position to actually perform his first human rescue. So, he'd be nowhere without Mr. Bitey, right? An adorable kitten is, unfortunately, the bane of Tommy (Kevin McKidd) in a gruesome twist. After his girlfriend Lizzie leaves him, the once drug-free Tommy turns to heroin and contracts AIDS. He tries to woo Lizzie back by giving her a kitten, but she refuses to take it. Tommy keeps the kitten, but sorely neglects it, leading to him dying of toxoplasmosis from cat feces. But it has a happy ending of sorts: As a friend tells Renton (Ewan McGregor) at Tommy's funeral, after all that, “The kitten was fine.” When on a mission inside the Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves) sees a black cat walk past and shake itself. Then the same cat walks past and does the exact same thing, and he remarks, “Déja vu.” That's when Trinity (Carrie Moss) realizes that something has been changed in the Matrix and they're all in real trouble. After an ATM instructs Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), “Feed me a stray cat,” he prepares to kill the nearest stray cat he sees. Luckily, the cat is one of the few victims who escapes from the yuppie psychopath. Whew! In one of the most memorable opening credit sequences of all time (courtesy of famed artist Saul Bass), a black cat and his long-legged shadow prowls the alleys as the Oscar-nominated theme song by Elmer Bernstein blares. The brief cat fight is the purr-fect set-up for a film set at a sleazy New Orleans brothel. The cat reappears in the closing credits, walking over a newspaper that details the scandal we've just watched. You can't have a movie about a notoriously haunted mansion without a black cat stalking photogenically past it at regular intervals. This lurid tale, based on the novel by Richard Matheson, is no exception. The cat makes its way inside the infamous Belasco House and attacks psychic Florence (Pamela Franklin). She seems to have killed it in self defense, but then we see the same cat resuming its patrol outside. A chance encounter with a kitten leads into one of the most famous film scenes of all time: Reporter Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) is infatuated with visiting film star Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) and gets his chance to be alone with her after her fiancée ignores her. The two wander the deserted streets of Rome at night, where Sylvia scoops up a stray white kitten and places it on her head. Marcello goes to look for milk for the kitty and returns to find Sylvia frolicking in the Trevi Fountain, having put the kitten down first, naturally. He gives the kitten the milk and wades in to join Sylvia. Ralph Bakshi directed this X-rated adaptation of the Robert Crumb comic about a hedonistic, talking cat. Fritz and his buddies do drugs, have group sex and run from the cops (who are literally pigs) in this controversial counterculture cartoon. Followed by The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat, which was made without Crumb or Bakshi. After Sam (Patrick Swayze) is killed, he tries to warn wife Molly (Demi Moore) that she's in danger. He realizes that their tabby, Floyd, can still sense him, so when his killer (Rick Aviles) breaks into their apartment, Sam screams at Floyd. The cat jumps at the killer, scaring him off, and saving the day. Okay, this is a terrible film with terrible, terrible animation, suitable only for anyone under five. The orange, lasagne-loving cat is voiced by Bill Murray, a career decision he deeply regrets, as we learned in Zombieland. At least we'll always have the comic strip and those millions of plush Garfields suction-cupped to car windows all over the world. The concept of dogs and cats waging a high-tech war for the hearts of humans is a rather cute one, as are many of the real cats and dogs in this film. But good luck getting past the extra-crappy CGI of such characters as the Ninja Cats. The one bright spot: An archvillain named Mr. Tinkles, a Persian who must suffer the indignity of being bathed and wearing a bonnet. Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes) registers his outrage to his kitty underlings, exclaiming, “Does evil wear a bonnet?!” In this case, yes. One of the most recognizable movie studio logos featured Leo the Lion roaring mightily. Actually, a lion named Leo has only been used by the studio since 1957: Before that, a series of other lions held down the job. Leo also appeared in several films, including King of Kings (1961) and a TV commercial for Dreyfus Investments in 1961. His distinctive roar) was trademarked by MGM. We might feel very differently about Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) if she'd made good on her threat to eat her sister Prim's cat. Yes, food is scarce in District 12, but Prim would never forgive her! Fortunately, the kitty and Katniss (who really should love cats with a name like that) both survive and even become friends by the end of this YA series. Buttercup was played by a black-and-white kitty in the first film and then, at the request of author Suzanne Collins, recast as a fluffy orange cat, as described in the books. Melissa McCarthy said that her kitty costar was the “Marlon Brando of cats.” The vet bills for her ailing pet motivate her character, writer Lee Israel, to begin her celebrity author letter-forging scheme. In the film, Jersey is a girl, but was played by a male cat named Towne. “The first time I take him, or her, to the vet, while we are at the counter he sneezed. And I looked at him and literally thought, 'Are you kidding me? Are you pretending to be sick? Then Marielle [Heller] cuts and I looked at the camera and said to myself, 'This cat is out-acting me!,” she told Deadline. Sadly, Jersey, passes away in the film, a very moving scene that no doubt helped clinch McCarthy's Oscar nomination. Life lesson: Don't let a Richard E. Grant character catsit for you. In this sequel to The Shining, a grown-up Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) takes a job at a hospice, where he's able to help make dying patients' last moments less scary by sharing memories of their past. He's aided by Azzie, the resident cat, who somehow knows when it's someone's time to go. Stephen King was inspired by real-life nursing home kitty Oscar, who made headlines for being able to predict the passing of terminally ill patients within hours. Oscar was also the subject of the 2010 book, Making Rounds with Oscar: The Extraordinary Gift of an Ordinary Cat In Lucio Fulci's (very loose) take on the Edgar Allan Poe tale, a wheelchair-bound professor with psychic abilities (Patrick Magee) gets revenge on his enemies by channeling evil spirits into his cat. So, every time the black cat appears, people die, starting with a man who crashes his car after finding the cat in his backseat. And here we can't even get our cats to run to the store for more kibble! Joseph Stefano (of Psycho fame) wrote this screenplay and David Lowell Rich (who'd go on to direct the B-movie classic Satan's School for Girls) directs this story of two caretakers who plot to do in an elderly woman. Trouble is, she has a lot of cats. And one of the plotters (Michael Sarrazin) is deathly afraid of them. Could it be the cats are onto them? And capable of taking revenge? A cat figures prominently in Ana Lily Amirpour's stylish vampire film: He's first seen with Arash (Arash Marandi) in the film's opening credits. In a key scene, Arash's father, Hossein (Marshall Manesh), who is going through heroin withdrawal, thinks that the cat is his dead wife. The cat almost seems to be acting to draw “The Girl” and Arash together. Amirpour told The Mary Sue that the cat, whose name is Masuka, was a dream to work with. “We had a very special little being, and it was that cat's destiny in life to make this movie…. We did a camera test, and Masuka is just this cat that likes to go into unfamiliar places and is curious about everything.” In François Truffaut's comedy about filmmaking, a director (played by Truffaut himself) has no end of headaches making a movie, including getting a gray kitten to eat from a tray of food on cue. After several failed attempts, the cat is fired! Finally, a tabby kitten is brought in and it (eventually) hits its mark and eats from the tray. Hurrah! The notorious film is considered the most dangerous ever made, because shooting with real wild animals resulted in 70 members of its cast and crew being injured. Its stars suffered life-threatening injuries, including fractures and scalpings. And much of the footage of the injuries was included in the final cut of the film! It was written and directed by Noel Marshall, starring his then wife Tippi Hedren, and her daughter Melanie Griffith. The plot: Things go very, very wrong when the family of Hank (Marshall) comes to visit him and his extensive menagerie, which includes 110 wild cats: lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, cougars and jaguars. The film was released theatrically in Europe in 1981, but was only shown in the United States for the first time in 2015. It's currently on YouTube. This Paul Verhoeven film opens with Michele (Isabelle Huppert)'s cat Marty watching blankly as her human is sexually assaulted. Later, Michele gently admonishes him, saying, “You didn't have to claw his eyes out, but you could have at least scratched him.” We later find out that the assailant first got in when Marty was slow to come inside. Marty isn't seen in the latter half of the film: Reportedly, Verhoeven had planned to kill off the cat, but with so many other deaths in the film, decided against it. ?One of the most famous cat actors of all time, Orangey, makes his debut here, although billed as the title character, Rhubarb. When a cat inherits a baseball team, all the players (including Leonard Nimoy!) want to quit. The team's publicist (Ray Milland) tells them he understands, “You couldn't take the meows and the purrs and the catcalls from the stands.” He tries to convince them the cat is actually good luck. And the cat gets a fantastic first credit: “Introducing the newest addition to Hollywood's great galaxy of stars—that dynamic, exciting, scintillating personality RHUBARB (by special arrangement with the SPCA).” He'd go on to star in Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Comedy of Terrors and guest star on Batman and My Favorite Martian In Roger Corman's morbid little black comedy, busboy Walter (Dick Miller) accidentally kills his landlady's cat—and turns it into a sculpture that has everyone declaring him the Next Big Thing. From there, he's on to killing people to fuel his artistic urges, much like Vincent Price in House of Wax A one-eyed cat named Fred becomes a plot point in this drama about who should have custody of a young math prodigy Mary: her equally brilliant uncle Frank (Chris Evans), who wants her to lead a normal life, or her controlling grandmother, Evelyn, who wants Mary to be whisked into the world of academia, like her mother was. The grandmother (who's allergic to cats) wins custody and when Fred shows up at a shelter, Frank knows that she's not abiding by any of his wishes in raising Mary. Happily, Fred is rescued, and Mary gets the best of both worlds—including her pet cat. In this Edgar Allan Poe anthology, The Black Cat is the “sardonically humorous tale” (as the original trailer describes it) of a man (Peter Lorre) who walls up his unfaithful wife with her lover (Vincent Price). But walling up the wife's cat with them—and the cat's subsequent cries—leads to the discovery of his crime. Guess you could call it the Telltale Cat.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_chart_achievements_and_milestones,Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones,"This is a comprehensive listing that highlights significant achievements and milestones based upon Billboard magazine's singles charts, most notably the Billboard Hot 100. This list spans the period from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The Billboard Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular music chart in the United States. Prior to the creation of the Hot 100, Billboard published four singles charts: ""Best Sellers in Stores"", ""Most Played by Jockeys"", ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" and ""The Top 100"". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations. All items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts). All-Time Hot 100 achievements (1958–2018) In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists. In 2013, Billboard revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition. In 2015, Billboard revised the rankings again. In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the Billboard chart's 60th anniversary. Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018. Also shown are the artists placing the most songs on the overall ""all-time"" top 100 song list.

When the songs originally charted in 1984, their chart positions in their final week on the Hot 100 were well below the top 10. Prior to 2008, the biggest drop off the Hot 100 was ""Nights in White Satin"" by The Moody Blues, which ranked at #17 in its final week on the chart in December 1972. This high drop-off position was matched in January 1975 by ""Junior's Farm"" by Paul McCartney and Wings. The record descent held for over three decades.  Each song above dropped off the Hot 100 upon four or fewer weeks; ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Junior's Farm"" dropped off after 18 and 12 weeks, respectively. Source: Seasonal songs During the holiday season, which includes Christmas, these songs regularly appear on the Hot 100, generally departing from the chart after the holiday season ends. In recent years, seasonal songs have reached into the top ten, and in 2019, for only the second time ever on the Hot 100 (the first since 1958), made it to number one. This has led to all-time records for dropping off the Hot 100, including from number one, as the songs depart the chart regardless of their final chart positions during the season.

Artist achievements Most number-one singles † The biggest number-one listed by each artist reflects its overall performance on the Hot 100, as calculated by Billboard, and may not necessarily be the single which spent the most weeks at #1 for the artist, such as Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" (six weeks at #1, compared to seven for ""Take a Bow""), Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"" (fourteen weeks at #1, compared to sixteen for her duet with Boyz II Men, ""One Sweet Day"") and Michael Jackson's duet with Paul McCartney, ""Say Say Say"" (six weeks at #1, compared to seven for both his solo singles ""Billie Jean"" and ""Black or White""). ‡ Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Billboard now credits the dual #1 Presley single ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" as a single chart entity, and credits Presley with 17 number one singles. ""Don't Be Cruel""/""Hound Dog"" spent 11 weeks at #1, ""Hound Dog"" for 6 weeks, ""Don't Be Cruel"" for 5 weeks. Many chart statisticians however, such as Joel Whitburn, still list Presley as having 18 number ones.  Source: Most cumulative weeks at number one † Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Presley is sometimes credited with an ""80th week"" that occurred when ""All Shook Up"" spent a ninth week on top of the ""Most Played in Jukeboxes"" chart. Although Billboard's chart statistician Joel Whitburn still counts this 80th week based on preexisting research, Billboard magazine itself has since revised its methodology and officially credits Presley with 79 weeks. Much of Presley's total factors in pre-Hot 100 data. If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Fergie, if Black Eyed Peas is included, this would put Fergie on the list with 34 weeks at #1. Note: For singer Michael Jackson, if The Jackson 5, which would also be later known as The Jacksons is included, this would give Michael Jackson 47 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For singer Beyoncé, if Destiny's Child is included, this would give Beyoncé 59 cumulative weeks at #1. All six weeks from the Perfect duet with Ed Sheeran are also included. Note: For singer Diana Ross, if The Supremes are included, this would give Diana Ross 42 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For each of the Beatles: If John Lennon's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give John Lennon 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Paul McCartney's total weeks were to include the Beatles, as well as Wings, this would give Paul McCartney 89 cumulative weeks at #1. If George Harrison's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give George Harrison 65 cumulative weeks at #1. If Ringo Starr's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give Ringo Starr 61 cumulative weeks at #1. Note: For rapper Drake if the track ""Sicko Mode"" is included, this would put Drake on the list with 50 weeks at #1. Most consecutive number-one singles Houston's ""Thinking About You"" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio. Likewise, Perry's ""Not Like the Movies"" and ""Circle the Drain"" were only promotional singles, not radio singles. With the streak spanning from her debut single ""Vision of Love"" until ""Emotions,"" Mariah Carey became the first artist in Hot 100 history to have their first 5 solo singles reach #1 on the chart.

Kelly and Céline Dion (December 5, 1998). Though the song was making its first appearance on the Hot 100 that week, Billboard did not consider it a debut at #1, since it appeared on unpublished test charts prior to the allowance of airplay-only songs on the main chart. ""I'm Your Angel"" also entered the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart that week at #1, so it would have been ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 before then. The first ""airplay-only"" song to reach #1 (no points from a commercial single release) was ""Try Again"" by Aaliyah (June 17, 2000). Drake holds the record for the most entries in the Hot 100 during a one-week period, with 27 on the July 14, 2018 chart. The Beatles had long held this record, occupying 14 positions on the Hot 100 dated April 11, 1964, a feat unmatched for nearly 51 years. On March 7, 2015, Drake tied the Beatles mark, and he equaled it again on October 17 that year. Justin Bieber then reset the record to 17 on December 5, 2015, before Drake reclaimed the record with 20 on May 21, 2016, and broke his own record with 27 on July 14, 2018. Drake also holds the record for the most debuting entries on a Hot 100 chart by any artist, with 22 on July 14, 2018. Taylor Swift is the record-holder among female artists for the most simultaneous entries in the Hot 100, with 18 on the September 7, 2019 chart. Previous record holders were Billie Eilish (14), Cardi B (13), Ariana Grande (12), and Beyoncé (12). Ariana Grande is the record-holder among female artists with the most songs charting in the top 40 simultaneously, with 11 on the February 23, 2019 chart. The Beatles are the only artists to simultaneously hold the top 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 albums chart. They achieved this feat for nine consecutive weeks, from February 29, 1964, to April 25, 1964. For the first five weeks of that run, through March 28, 1964, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You"" were the #1 and #2 singles (which swapped positions during March 1964), while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles held the top 2 spots on the albums charts. For the remaining weeks of the run, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and their cover of ""Twist and Shout"" were the #1 and #2 singles, while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles continued their reign as the top 2 albums. Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney hold the record of writing all of the Top 3 singles for one week. The Gibbs co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 18, 1978 – #1 ""Night Fever"" and #2 ""Stayin' Alive"" for the Bee Gees, and #3 ""Emotion"" for Samantha Sang. Lennon and McCartney co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 14, 1964 – #1 ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", #2 ""She Loves You"", and #3 ""Please Please Me"", all for The Beatles. They continued this record the following week of March 21, 1964, when ""She Loves You"" switched places with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". The Black Eyed Peas hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time at #1 on the Hot 100, a total of 26 consecutive weeks from April to October 2009. ""Boom Boom Pow"" spent the first 12 weeks on top, with ""I Gotta Feeling"" taking over for the remaining 14 weeks. Prior to August 2009, Usher held this record, spending 19 consecutive weeks on top of the chart in 2004 with ""Yeah!"" (12 weeks at #1) and ""Burn"" (first 7 of its 8 total weeks at #1). On December 4, 2010, Rihanna's ""Only Girl (In the World)"" reached the top spot two weeks after ""What's My Name?"", becoming the first time in Hot 100 history that an album's debut single hit #1 after the second single did. Ed Sheeran became the first artist to debut more than one song in the top 10 for the same week. On the chart dated January 28, 2017, ""Shape of You"" debuted at #1, while ""Castle on the Hill"" entered at #6. Drake later achieved this feat on three separate occasions, doing so on April 8, 2017, February 3, 2018, and July 14, 2018. In the latter week, Drake broke the record by debuting four songs in the top 10. Drake is the only artist to have a number-one debut replace another number-one debut. He did this April 21, 2018, when ""Nice For What"" replaced ""God's Plan"" at the summit, after the latter had spent eleven weeks on top. Drake holds the record for being on the Hot 100 for the most consecutive weeks. He placed at least one song, either in a lead or featured role, on every chart from his debut on May 23, 2009, to August 19, 2017, for a total of 431 weeks in a row. Ariana Grande is the only artist to have the lead single from each of her first five albums debut in the Hot 100's top 10. On July 14, 2018, Drake set the record for the most songs in the top ten at once, with seven. The Beatles had previously held the record, since 1964, with five entries. Ariana Grande is the first artist whose first two number-one songs both debuted at the top. She achieved this with the songs ""Thank U, Next"" and ""7 Rings"", on the charts dated November 17, 2018 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Mariah Carey is the first artist to have a number-one single in four different decades after ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" topped the chart in January 2020 for a third consecutive week. Previously, she had fourteen number-one hits in the 1990s, four in the 2000s, and ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" starting its run at the top spot in December 2019.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/countries-worlds-innovative,Which countries are the world's most innovative?,"Once again, Switzerland remains the global leader in innovation, followed by the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United States. The United States continues to set the international benchmark for innovation quality in terms of scientific publications, patents and university rankings, according to the index, followed by the United Kingdom and Japan, among high-income nations. By the same measure, China, Brazil and India lead middle-income countries. The Global Innovation Index measures 141 nations that account for more than 95 percent of the world's population and nearly 99 percent of the globe's gross domestic product, as measured in US dollars. Researchers weighed each country's performance in innovation based on 79 indicators that include political and regulatory environment, education, credit, investment and creative goods and services. Not all nations are included in the index. The conditions under which innovation thrives don't happen overnight, explained Sacha Wunsch-Vincent, senior economist with the World Intellectual Property Organization, which helps to produce the index each year. The relationship between a country's stability, its economic output and its ability to encourage innovation are tightly woven together. Continued unrest in Sudan is one reason why that nation remains at the bottom of the index, she said. “One important foundation for innovation policy in any country is to support the right innovation infrastructure, literacy and mindset,” said Wunsch-Vincent via e-mail.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate,Countries by traffic-related death rate,"This list of countries by traffic-related death rate shows the annual number of road fatalities per capita per year, per number of motor vehicles, and per vehicle-km in some countries in the year the data was collected. According to the World Health Organization, road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.35 million deaths worldwide in the year 2016. That is, one person is killed every 25 seconds. Only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (seven percent of the world's population), have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drunk driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints). Over a third of road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income countries are among pedestrians and cyclists. However, less than 35 percent of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to protect these road users. The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100,000, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100,000. 74 percent of road traffic deaths occur in middle-income countries, which account for only 53 percent of the world's registered vehicles. In low-income countries it is even worse. Only one percent of the world's registered cars produce 16 percent of world's road traffic deaths. This indicates that these countries bear a disproportionately high burden of road traffic deaths relative to their level of motorization. There are large disparities in road traffic death rates between regions. The risk of dying as a result of a road traffic injury is highest in the African Region (26.6 per 100 000 population), and lowest in the European Region (9.3 per 100 000). Adults aged between 15 and 44 years account for 59 percent of global road traffic deaths. 77 percent of road deaths are males. The total fatalities figures comes from the WHO report (table A2, column point estimate, pp. 264–271) and are often an adjusted number of road traffic fatalities in order to reflect the different reporting and counting methods among the many countries (e.g., ""a death after how many days since accident event is still counted as a road fatality?"" (by international standard adjusted to a 30-day period), or ""to compensate for under-reporting in some countries"".

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/13/how-much-does-it-cost-eurovision-song-contest-and-is-it-worth-it,How much does it cost to host the Eurovision Song Contest and is it worth it?,"t may be one of the cultural highlights of the year, but the Eurovision Song Contest does not come cheap. A team of economists have calculated how much money each of the last four host cities have spent on the singing competition and can now reveal that they forked out a combined total of £129m. The city of Baku, in Azerbaijan, which hosted the contest in 2012, has been the biggest spender in recent years with a total hosting cost of £48m after building the brand new Baku Crystal Hall specifically for the event. That was offset by tourism spending of just £7m, but did lead to the creation of 529 full-time jobs. A year later, Malmo in Sweden kept costs down to £17m, and recouped £16m of that through tourism spending as 32,000 people made their way to the city. In 2014, the Danish capital Copenhagen spent £36m and received £13 in tourism spending, while last year's hosts Vienna paid £28m and received £22m thanks an influx of 32,000 tourists. It comes as SVT, Sweden's national broadcaster, set aside a budget of £11m for the privilege of hosting this year's acts such as British hopefuls Joe Woolford and Jake Shakeshaft. The Natwest economists have calculated that, for that money, the broadcaster could instead buy five years worth of the Great British Bake Off, three episodes of The X Factor, three and a half episodes of the Night Manager, a single Premier League match next season or 3.7 million copies of Abba's Waterloo on vinyl. So it is worth it? The economists write: “It's hard to be conclusive. Every host city has seen a modest boost in short-term tourism and in their local economy. “The longer-term benefits are harder to estimate but with over 180 million viewers worldwide, the international, positive exposure that comes as part of hosting is likely to dramatically increase tourism-related revenue. “Plus, there's the kudos of winning, and in some eyes that's just as important.”",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_mining_companies_by_revenue,Largest mining companies by revenue,This is a list of the largest mining companies  in terms of revenue (in US billion dollars) as ranked by Statista in 2015.,,0.234062,"[['No','Company','Revenue (billion US dollars)','Headquarters']['1','Glencore','209.2','Switzerland']['2','BHP Billiton','69.4','Australia']['3','Rio Tinto','45.1','']['4','China Shenhua Energy','40','China']['5','Vale','33.2','Brazil']]",No|Company|Revenue (billion US dollars)|Headquarters

It assumes the runner-up spot from The Phantom of the Opera, and now trails directly behind The Lion King. Check out how other shows fared for the week ending July 9. Since beginning performances at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003, Wicked has grossed approximately $1.12 billion. The musical reached the 10-figure milestone in March 2016, joining The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera. It surpassed $1 billion faster than both of its Billionaire's Club predecessors.* Read: BROADWAY'S WICKED PASSES BILLION-DOLLAR MARK AT THE BOX OFFICE The Phantom of the Opera has grossed a total of $1.11 billion on Broadway since beginning its run at the Majestic Theatre in 1988. However, The Lion King reigns over the Broadway box office, coming in at $1.38 billion; it celebrates its 20-year anniversary on Broadway this fall. While The Lion King and Wicked consistently gross over $1 million week-to-week and assume mainstay positions in the leaderboard, The Phantom of the Opera's numbers fluctuate throughout the calendar year. As do many shows, the musical faces a dip in the post-holiday winter months, but frequently reaches seven figures in more tourist-friendly periods; the musical, which holds the record as the longest-running production on Broadway, has remained in the $1.1 million margin for the past eight weeks.

https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-5-most-deadly-guns-modern-war-11659,The 5 Deadliest Guns of Modern War,"While everyone oohs and aahs over nuclear weapons, submarines and stealth fighters, modern wars usually involve infantries on the ground—and they need guns. Modern warfare has seen breathtaking advances in the last hundred years, as mortal competition between nations spawns successively deadlier weapons. Aircraft, missiles, tanks, submarines and other inventions—many of which did not exist in practical terms in 1914—have quickly earned key positions in the militaries of the world. Yet there is still one invention that, although conceived more than five hundred years ago, still has a vital place on today's battlefield: the infantry weapon and supporting arms. No matter how high tech the armed forces of the world have become, warfare since the end of the Second World War has consistently involved some form of infantry combat. In his seminal work on the Korean War, This Kind of War, historian TR Fehrenbach wrote, “you may fly over a land forever; you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and wipe it clean of life—but if you desire to defend it, protect it and keep it for civilization, you must do this on the ground, the way the Roman legions did, by putting your young men in the mud.” With that in mind, here are five of the most deadly guns of modern war. AK-47: The undisputed king of the modern battlefield is the Avtomat Kalashnikova model 47, or AK-47. Extremely reliable, the AK-47 is plentiful on Third World battlefields. From American rap music to Zimbabwe, the AK-47 has achieved icon status, and is one of the most recognizable symbols—of any kind—in the world. The AK series of rifles is currently carried by fighters of the Islamic State, Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, various factions in Libya and both sides in the Ukraine conflict. The AK-47, as the story goes, was the brainchild of the late Mikhail T. Kalashnikov. A Red Army draftee, Kalashnikov showed a talent for small-arms design while convalescing from battlefield injuries, and had assembled a prototype assault rifle by 1947. (There is some circumstantial evidence, however, that the AK-47 was at least partially designed by the German designer Hugo Schmeisser, who had created the similar Stg44 in 1942.) The AK-47 was the world's first standard-issue assault rifle. The rifle used a new 7.62-millimeter cartridge that generated less recoil and was lighter than rounds used in traditional infantry rifles. In return, the 7.62x39 round offered more controllability when fired in full automatic and allowed the infantryman to carry more rounds into battle. The AK-47 has endured because it is a weapon for the lowest common denominator. It requires little training to learn how to shoot, and as a result large armies or militias can be raised by simply handing out AK-47s. It is dead simple to use and requires little maintenance. Disassembly is quick and the weapon can run virtually without lubrication. All of these are important considerations when your soldiers or militiamen are often illiterate, untrained draftees. An estimated one hundred million AK-47s of all varieties have been manufactured by countries including the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Egypt, Yugoslavia and most of the former Warsaw Pact. As The Independent pointed out, that could be one AK for every seventy people on Earth. Even Finland and Israel, neither Soviet allies nor client states, built variants. The most recent version issued to the Russian Army is the AK-74M, chambered in the lighter 5.45-millimeter. The M16 family of weapons: The modern M16 rifle got its start in 1956, when inventor Eugene Stoner tested its predecessor, the AR-15, at the Infantry School at Fort Benning. The rifle would not enter US service for another four years, and then with the US Air Force. The US Army would jump on the M16 bandwagon in 1965, with the US Marines following in 1966. The original AR-15 was a reliable, innovative rifle, but a last-minute change of gunpowder and misconceptions about the rifle's need to be cleaned contributed to a poor reliability rate in Vietnam. Exacerbating the problem was the M16's direct impingement self-loading system, in which gasses and carbon residue created when gunpowder is burned are cycled back into the weapon's internal mechanism. The most recent version, the M16A4, weighs 8.79 pounds loaded with a 30-round magazine. The rifle is effective to 550 meters, with a sustained rate of fire of 12-15 rounds per minute. The 5.56-millimeter SS109/M855 bullet, which emphasized armor-piercing capability over lethality on NATO battlefields, is being phased out in favor of the M855A1 round. The original M16 led to the improved M16A1 by 1967, and the M16A2 by 1986. The M16A3 was a short-run rifle built for Navy SEALs, while the M16A4 has become standard issue in the US Marine Corps. The M4A1 carbine, currently the standard-issue infantry weapon for the US Army, is identical except for a shorter barrel, collapsible stock and the ability to be fired fully automatic. The M16 has evolved into a reliable rifle. Modular and highly adaptable, variants have fulfilled roles from carbine to infantry rifle, squad automatic weapon and designated marksman rifle. The civilian version, again dubbed AR-15, has enjoyed explosive growth in the last ten years with the sunset of the Federal assault-weapons ban. The author owns two. M240 Machine Gun: The M240 Machine Gun is the current medium machine gun for the US Army and US Marine Corps. The M240 is in service with another sixty-eight countries and has served long enough that at least one adopter—Rhodesia—is no longer in existence. The M240 is the American version of the FN-MAG designed in the 1950s by the Belgian arms maker Fabrique Nationale (FN). Utilizing features from both Axis and Allied infantry weapons, the MAG, as it was known, became wildly popular and standard issue with many NATO countries. In the years since introduction, the MAG has served from South Africa to the Falklands, to Afghanistan and Iraq. The M240 can be used to engage point targets, such as individual enemy troops and light vehicles, or provide suppressive fire. The M240's heavier 7.62-millimeter bullet gives it a maximum effective range of up to 1,800 meters. The M240 weighs 27 pounds, and with spare barrel, tripod, and other accessories and spare parts can weigh in at up to 47 pounds. The M240 can fire 100 rounds per minute sustained fire, meaning the weapon will not overheat. It can fire up to 650 rounds per minute, but overheating is imminent. Obviously, too many countries use the M240 to run down its use in every case, but the state of issue in the US military is typical of use worldwide. In the US Army, M240 machine guns are found on armored vehicles and issued at a rate of two per infantry platoon. In the US Marine Corps, six guns are issued to an infantry company, allowing the company commander flexibility in their deployment. PK Machine Gun The PK (Pulemyot Kalashnikova, or “Kalashnikov's machine gun”) light machine gun was the Soviet Union's solution to high firepower at the squad level. Like the AK-47, the PK has seen extensive use around the world—where one finds an AK, a PK is never far behind. The PK was also invented by Mikhail Kalashnikov. Although it resembles the M240, it is in the same class as the US Marine Corps' M-27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, or the NATO Minimi/M-249 Squad Automatic Weapon. The PK fills an important role as a Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). Although most infantrymen throughout the world carry weapons capable of fully automatic or burst fire, trained soldiers rarely fire full auto. Full-auto fire from lightweight assault rifles is generally inaccurate and rapidly consumes ammunition. Instead, a single gun like the PK is designated as the squad automatic weapon. The PK is equipped with a heavier barrel and frame to absorb heat and recoil from sustained fire. Accuracy, particularly mounted on a tripod, is reported to be excellent out to 800 meters. The PK uses the same sights as the AK-47 to ease training. The PK uses a heavier hitting round than the AK-47, the 7.64x54r round originally used in the Moisin Nagant infantry rifle and Degtyaryov machine gun in World War II. The PK has some anti-aircraft capability while the gun is mounted to a bipod or tripod, although realistically that is limited to low-flying helicopters and perhaps drones. QBZ-95 Assault Rifle The QBZ-95, or “Type 95 Automatic Rifle” is the standard-issue assault rifle of China. Designed to replace the Chinese copy of the AK-47, the QBZ-95 is unlike any other Chinese rifle. The rifle is issued to all arms of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the People's Armed Police. The QBZ-95 is a bullpup design, with the magazine inserted behind the trigger. Like other bullpup rifles, this shortens the overall length of the rifle. The result is a rifle with a barrel 3.5” longer than the M4 carbine, but shorter in overall length. The rifle features a built-in carrying handle, although the use of such a handle creates issues when attaching scopes and other optics. An entire line of infantry weapons has grown up around the QBZ-95. A carbine version with a shorter overall length is available for vehicle crews and special forces, while a heavier barrel variant is available to boost squad firepower. Unfortunately, the heavier version cannot accept belt-fed ammunition and only takes 30-round magazines, limiting its ability to provide high-volume firepower.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_last_World_War_I_veterans_by_country,Last World War I veterans by country,"This is a list of the last World War I veterans to die by country.

Ovechkin scored twice off of two gorgeous primary assists from Evgeny Kuznetsov, leapfrogging Bobby Hull for the 16th most goals in NHL history. But that's not all. The Capitals captain has the fourth most goals in NHL history among any player through their first fourteen seasons in the NHL. Ovechkin only trails Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and Marcel Dionne with 611 goals. If Ovechkin scores 44 goals or more during the next 79 games, he would jump into second place behind the Great One. The 33-year-old Russian has also scored two or more goals in 122 games since his debut in 2005, which is the most in the NHL since 1993. Since 2005, Ovechkin has 41 more multi-goal games than the next closest player, Sidney Crosby. Ovechkin also moved up to fourth place for all-time goals scored as a left wing. Luc Robitaille sits at the top with 668 goals, a number that Ovechkin should pass within the next two seasons. Ovechkin has the third highest multi-goal games of a European player in NHL history. He trails Teemu Selanne and Jaromir Jagr With his two goals, Ovechkin tied Jari Kurri for fifteenth most multi-goal games in NHL history as well. The Capitals' captain tied Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Bossy for 57th most points in NHL history with 1,126. Ovechkin has a 1.12 points-per-game average over his first 1,006 games. It's easy to normalize the greatness of Alex Ovechkin. He's scored goals at an astronomical rate for so long that Capitals' fans are accustomed to watching him shatter record after record. The Capitals' captain is the greatest Russian hockey player of all-time and one of the greatest players of all-time. Ovechkin came into this season in better shape, as a new father, and as a Stanley Cup champion. It took him three games into the season to break multiple records in a game. This is Alex Ovechkin's world, and we're all living in it.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_Olympic_medalists,Multiple Olympic medalists,"This article provides a list of multiple Olympic medalists, i.e. those athletes who have won multiple Olympic medals at either the Summer Olympic Games or the Winter Olympic Games. American swimmer Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian, having won 28 medals in both individual and team events (23 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze). Has also won more individual events than any other Olympian, with 16 medals (13 gold, 2 silver, and 1 bronze). Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen is the most decorated Winter Olympian, with 15 medals (8 gold, 4 silver, and 3 bronze). List of Olympic medals over career This list includes athletes who have won seven or more Olympic medals over their sporting career. It includes top-three placings in the 1896 Olympic Games and 1900 Olympic Games, before medals were actually awarded for those placings. Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. For simplicity, when an athlete has won medals for more than one nation, their entry in this list only mentions the last Nation represented. The Years listed for each athlete only include the Games in which they won medals. More detailed information is provided in the linked articles for the individual athletes. In cases where two or more athletes have the same number of total medals, the first tiebreaker is the number of gold medals, followed by the number of silver medals. If the tied athletes have exactly the same number of gold, silver and bronze medals, the ranking is given as a tie and the athletes are listed in order first by career years and then alphabetically by surname. Timeline This is a progressive list of Olympians that have held the record for most medals won. Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. It includes top-three placings in 1896 and 1900, before medals were awarded for top-three placings. All record-holders have competed at Summer Games rather than Winter Games. Legend: G = Gold, S = Silver, B = Bronze. List of most career medals in individual events This list contains only medals won in individual events, so no relays or team events count for this section. Athletes with medals in different disciplines In the Summer and Winter Games Gillis Grafström became the first person to win a medal in the same event in Summer and Winter Olympics, winning figure skating golds at the 1920 Olympics and at the first Winter Olympics in 1924. Eddie Eagan became the first person to win a medal in the Winter Olympics and in the Summer Olympics in different events. He is the only Summer and Winter medalist to win gold medals in different events. Christa Luding-Rothenburger is the only person to win medals at the Winter and Summer Games in the same year. (This feat is no longer possible due to the staggering of the Winter and Summer Olympic years).  She is also the first person to win medals in successive Winter and Summer Games or vice versa. Clara Hughes is the first person to win multiple medals in both Summer and Winter Games and holds the highest number of medals of any Olympian to win medals in both the Summer and Winter Games.

https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Microsoft-Windows-Server-OS-operating-system,Microsoft Windows Server OS (operating system),"Microsoft Windows Server OS (operating system) is a series of enterprise-class server operating systems designed to share services with multiple users and provide extensive administrative control of data storage, applications and corporate networks. Development for Windows Server started in the early 1980s when Microsoft produced two operating system lines: MS-DOS and Windows NT. Microsoft engineer David Cutler developed the kernel of Windows NT with the intent to provide speed, security and reliability that large organizations require in a server operating system. Prior to the release of Windows NT, many companies relied on the Unix operating system that required expensive RISC-based hardware to run file and printing services. Windows NT had the ability to run on less costly x86 machines. A key feature in the NT architecture is symmetric multiprocessing, which makes applications run faster on machines with several processors. Later iterations of Windows Server can be deployed either on hardware in an organization's data center or on a cloud platform, such as Microsoft Azure. Key features in later versions of Windows Server include Active Directory, which automates the management of user data, security and distributed resources, and enables interoperation with other directories; and Server Manager, which is a utility to administer server roles and make configuration changes to local or remote machines. Microsoft released its Windows NT operating system in two formats: one for workstations and the other for servers. The 32-bit operating system featured a hardware abstraction layer (HAL), which provided more system stability by blocking applications from direct access to system hardware. Companies could use Advanced Server as a domain controller to store user and group rights. Microsoft updated key networking features in this server release and added integrated support for TCP/IP and Winsock. Other networking improvements allowed users on other non-Microsoft operating systems to access files and applications on the domain. Microsoft fine-tuned this release to boost performance and reduce the amount of required memory. This server OS was optimized to deliver services faster to users through its updated networking stack. Microsoft added more connectivity support for companies in a mixed environment with both Windows NT and NetWare servers to allow users to get services from each with a single credential. Microsoft borrowed the Windows 95 interface for this server OS release and also used many of the applications in the client OS, such as the File Explorer. Microsoft expanded the networking protocol capabilities in this release to make network resources available to a wider array of non-Microsoft machines. Key features in this release were the ability to use a server as an Internet Information Server -- now called Internet Information Services (IIS) -- and a domain name system server. This server OS also could walk administrators through various tasks, such as sharing a hard disk with a feature called Administrative Wizards. Windows 2000 introduced Active Directory, a directory service that stores and manages information about network objects, including user data, systems and services. Active Directory lets administrators perform various tasks, such as virtual private network configuration, data encryption and granting access to file shares on networked computers. Microsoft also introduced several other key features in this release, including: Microsoft Management Console (MMC), NTFS 3.0 file system and support for dynamic disk volumes. Windows 2000 had three editions -- Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter -- that were built to work with Windows 2000 Professional, the client OS. Microsoft introduced the ""Windows Server"" brand with the release of Windows Server 2003 and touted its security improvements over Windows 2000. Microsoft hardened IIS, the web server feature, and disabled more default services to reduce exploit opportunities. Microsoft introduced server roles with this release, which allowed administrators to assign a specific function to a server, such as domain controller or DNS server. Other new features in this release included expanded encryption functionality, built-in firewall, greater Network Address Translation (NAT) support and Volume Shadow Copy Service. Windows Server 2003 had four editions: Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter and Web. Rather than a version number, Microsoft began using the R2 -- or release two -- designation with Windows Server 2003 R2. Organizations always need to buy a new Windows Server license to use the new server operating system, but R2 releases used the client access licenses (CALs) of the immediately preceding server version to eliminate the need to upgrade those licenses. This version improved on the security and safety features in Windows Server 2003. Key new features in this release were: Active Directory Federation Services, which lets administrators broaden single sign-on access to applications and systems beyond the corporate firewall. Active Directory Application Mode, which stores data for applications that may be considered not secure enough to use in the Active Directory system. This version also added enhancements to file replication and data compression for branch office servers. Among the security improvements in this release was the Security Configuration Wizard, which let administrators apply consistent security policies to multiple machines. Windows Server 2008 added new features such as: Hyper-V virtualization software, failover clustering, Event Viewer, Server Core -- the minimal deployment option managed via the command line, and Server Manager console, used to add and manage server roles and features on local and remote machines. Microsoft also overhauled the networking stack and Active Directory to enhance its Group Policy and identity management capabilities. Windows Server 2008 came in four editions: Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter and Web. Microsoft used its Windows 7 kernel for this server operating system and touted its improved scalability and availability features. Microsoft enhanced Active Directory for improved handling of user accounts and more granular control with policies. The company also updated Terminal Services functionality and rechristened it to Remote Desktop Services (RDS). New features in this release include BranchCache and DirectAccess, both aimed at improving how users in remote locations are able to get their work done. This server OS, like its predecessor, shares some of the administrative and security functionality used in the Windows Vista client operating system. Windows Server 2008 R2 also marked a change from a 32-bit server operating system to a 64-bit version. Microsoft embedded a number of cloud-related features to Windows Server 2012, going so far as to dub it the ""Cloud OS,"" so organizations could run services more easily in public or private clouds. The company also made significant updates to the operating system's storage infrastructure and Hyper-V virtualization platform. New features worth noting in this release were the Hyper-V virtual switch, Hyper-V Replica, Storage Spaces and ReFS file system. In another change with this release, Microsoft switched the default installation option to Server Core, which requires administrators to use PowerShell. Upon this release, PowerShell had 2,300 cmdlets available for management. This server version came in four editions: Essentials, Foundation, Standard and Datacenter. The Standard and Datacenter editions had the same feature set, but a Standard license permitted organizations to run two virtual machines (VMs), while Datacenter permitted an unlimited number of VMs. Microsoft made expansive changes across the board with Windows Server 2012 R2, including significant updates to virtualization, storage, networking, information security and web services. New features of note: Desired State Configuration (DSC) built on PowerShell to prevent configuration drift and maintain consistency across the organization's machines. Storage tiering added to Storage Spaces boosts performance by automatically moving frequently called blocks of data to solid-state storage. Work Folders allow users to retrieve and save company files on work and personal devices through replication to servers in the organization's data center. Microsoft nudged enterprises closer to the cloud with a number of new features tailored to ease workload migrations, such as support for Docker containers and software-defined enhancements in networking. Microsoft debuted Nano Server, a minimal server deployment option intended to boost security by shrinking the attack vector. Microsoft says Nano Server is 93% smaller than a full Windows Server deployment. Another nod to security comes in the new Hyper-V shielded VM feature, which uses encryption to prevent data inside a VM from being compromised. The Network Controller is a key new networking feature that allows administrators to manage the switches, subnets and other devices on the virtual and physical networks. This server OS comes in Standard and Datacenter editions. In previous Windows Server versions, the Standard and Datacenter editions had the same feature set, but different license rights and use restrictions. In Windows Server 2016, the Standard edition does not have the more advanced features in virtualization, storage and networking. In June 2017, Microsoft announced it would split Windows Server into two channels: the Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) and the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) -- formerly the Long-Term Servicing Branch. The SAC caters to enterprises with a DevOps framework that prefer a shorter term between feature updates to get the most recent updates for rapid application development cycles. SAC releases will come every six months -- one in the spring and one in the fall -- with mainstream support of just 18 months. Microsoft tailors the LTSC for companies that prefer the more traditional release cycle of two to three years between major feature updates with the typical five years of mainstream support followed by five years of extended support. The LTSC naming convention will retain the Windows Server YYYY format -- such as Windows Server 2016 -- while the SAC releases will follow a format of Windows Server version YYMM. Microsoft said it plans to add most of the enhancements -- with some variations -- from the SAC releases into upcoming LTSC releases. Microsoft released its first SAC release -- Windows Server version 1709 -- in October 2017. Highlights of this release were support for Linux containers with kernel isolation provided by Hyper-V and a refactored Nano Server strictly for use as a base OS container image. Businesses with Software Assurance on their Windows Server Standard or Datacenter licenses or a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) license can download the SAC releases from Microsoft's Volume Licensing Service Center. Organizations without Software Assurance can use SAC releases in Azure or another cloud or hosting environment.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_software_companies,The largest software companies,"Many lists exist that provide an overview of large software companies, often called ""independent software vendors"" (""ISVs""), in the world. The lists differ by methodology of composition and consequently show substantial differences in both listed companies and ranking of those companies. Legend Forbes Global 2000 The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine, based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets and market value. The Forbes list for software companies includes only pure play (or nearly pure play) software companies and excludes manufacturers, consumer electronics companies, conglomerates, IT consulting firms, and computer services companies even if they have large software divisions. For example, IBM would likely rank #3 in 2017 if its software business unit had been a separate company. The omission of more diversified firms can be useful to investors who are seeking either more or less exposure in the software sector. The top 10 companies in the 2017 Forbes list for the ""Software & Programming"" industry are listed in the following table: All values listed in the table are in billion US$, Google Stock lists market capitalization as of January 18th 2019.",,0.319551,"[['Rank','Organization','Organization','Sales (B$)','FY','Market cap (B$)','Headquarters']['1','','Alphabet','110.86','2018','766.84','Mountain View, CA, US']['2','','Microsoft','110.36','2018','826.94','Redmond, WA, US']['3','','IBM','79.9','2018','112.53','Armonk, NY, US']['4','','Accenture','41.1','2018','100.13','Dublin, IE']['5','','Facebook','40.65','2018','431.18','Menlo Park, CA, US']['6','','Oracle','39.83','2018','176.83','Redwood City, CA, US']['7','','SAP','26.7','2018','129.4','Walldorf, DE']['8','','Tencent','22.8','2018','277.1','Shenzhen, CN']['9','','TCS','19.08','2018','102.6','Mumbai, MH, IN']['10','','Baidu','10.6','2018','59.9','Beijing, CN']]",Rank|Organization|Organization|Sales (B$)|FY|Market cap (B$)|Headquarters
https://tformers.com/transformers-online-certain-affinity-studios-working-on-new-third-person-shooter/34761/news.html,TRANSFORMERS ONLINE - Certain Affinity Studios Working On New Third-Person Shooter,"Via GameDaily.biz, Hasbro Investor reports that a new Transformers game is currently under development, most likely for consoles and/or Steam! Developed by Certain Affinity - a company with few full games under their belt but solid bonafides for shooters that dates back as far as Halo 2 - the game is expected to once again be a third-person series as the High Moon Studios games were. (With High Moon themselves currently indisposed as permanent backup for Bungie on Destiny, sadly we don't expect to see them return to the franchise.) Little is known about the game other than its tentative title of ""Transformers Online,"" its developer, and its genre - but there's also a disclosure of acquisition from a company with a 20% stake in Certain Affinity that mentions that their specific license to Transformers covers the G1 period of 1984-95, and the modern ""Generations"" setting. If we were betting, we'd expect this game to tie into the War For Cybertron trilogy, and if so we hope they will title the game very carefully to avoid confusion.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_turn-based_strategy_video_games,Turn-based strategy video games,"This is a comprehensive index of turn-based strategy video games, sorted chronologically.

It earned an impressive 1.464 billion yen on 1.145 million admissions in its first Saturday and Sunday, which was the highest record in the franchise and 113% of the previous 22nd film Zero the Enforcer's record (1.296 billion yen) one year ago. The 110-minute film was released in 363 theaters across Japan on April 12, Friday, and made 1.886 billion yen, which was 188 million yen more than Zero, from the 1.458 million tickets sales in its first three days, Friday through Sunday. The Conan film series has been breaking its opening weekend box office record for six consecutive titles since its 17th film Private Eye in the Distant Sea in 2013. It is certain that The Fist of Blue Sapphire will renew the franchise record again, surpassing the current top-grossing record of 9.18 billion yen by Zero. And even there is a possibility that it will reach the 10 billion yen milestone. The Fist of Blue Sapphire also finally stopped the box office domination by Doraemon: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration that had topped the Japanese box office for six consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, the Doraemon anime franchise's 39th feature film had earned 4.69 billion yen from its seven-week domestic run and has become the top-grossing Japanese film of this year surpassing 46-year-old idol Takuya Kimura- starring mystery Masquerade Hotel with 4.58 billion yen.

A competition held by Transport NSW for the lucky 48 on the monorail's last ride after 25 years of service attracted 1500 entries, taking Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian by surprise. The Sydney Monorail just never quite fit in with the hustle and bustle of big city living and so the decision has been made for it to be dismantled. The number of people catching Sydney's unloved monorail is increasing as it's finals day of operation nears.Patronage this month is up 15 per cent on the same period last year. Picture: Fastier Braden ""It was always more of a novelty rather than an actual transport purpose,"" Gladys Berejiklian, Minister for Transport, said. ""That was one of the reasons why we discontinued it. The doomed Sydney Monorail which will be decommissioned soon, passing George Street in front of Queen Victoria Building. Picture: Craig Greenhill ""Not only does it give us an opportunity to redevelop this precinct and introduce light rail, it also discontinues a part of our transport network that never really fit in."" The doomed Sydney Monorail which will be decommissioned soon, passing George Street in front of Queen Victoria Building. Picture: Craig Greenhill The system will be dismantled at a cost of between $10 million and $15 million. ""The dismantling will start in August,"" Ms Berejiklian said. ""(But) we are going to preserve 10m of track and two carriages."" Helen Roberts, from Lilyfield, said her children Sam, 8, and Tom, 7, relished the last day of rides and even asked a friend, Leo, 8, to come along with them. ""I think they were just enjoying the fact that it was the last ride,"" Ms Roberts, 44, said. The Sydney Monorail's final ride took place ar 9.30pm last night. For Michael Sweeney, last night's final loop was the perfect bookend for his close association with the Monorail. He was a passenger on the Monorail's first day of operation in 1988 and used it for commuting into the city from his Ultimo home for years. The number of people catching Sydney's unloved monorail is increasing as it's finals day of operation nears.Patronage this month is up 15 per cent on the same period last year. Picture: Fastier Braden ""A lot of people hated it, but I just loved it from day one. There were a lot of people protesting, saying that it ruin the amenity of the city and drop oil on people below, but for me, I was from the generation that grew up with Lost In Space, and Star Trek, and this was futuristic, and it was great,'' he said. ""I'm sad to see it go, but it probably has reached its day."" Among the rail aficionados, admirers and former workers who won a spot on the final loop that left the Darling Park platform at 9.30pm last night, were a handful of kids getting their last Monorail fix. Cooper MacIntyre had travelled on the rail once a month in the past year. ""He loves it. He lives opposite a train line, so he likes trains and planes. He is quite excited and thinks he's quite a special boy going on the last one,"" dad Phillip said. ""I wished everyone used it like they are using it now. It is going to be missed by not only people in Sydney, but tourists who come and stay.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic,Busiest airports by passenger traffic,"The world's busiest airports by passenger traffic are measured by total passengers (data from Airports Council International), defined as passengers enplaned plus passengers deplaned plus direct-transit passengers.

https://www.dualshockers.com/gears-5-the-chain-trailer,Gears 5 Crosses Over with Fleetwood Mac in New Trailer Ahead of Launch,"The Gears of War series has never shied away from including popular licensed music in its trailers. The original video for Gears of War famously included Gary Jules' iteration of Mad World in what would become an iconic trailer. Later installments in the series would go on to use jams like Black Sabbath's War Pigs or, more recently, Nine Inch Nails and Head Like A Hole Now, a day before the launch of Gears 5, Microsoft and The Coalition have released a new video (or “launch film” as it's being called) featuring the tunes of Fleetwood Mac. The video, appropriately titled The Chain, since it features Fleetwood Mac's song of the same name, shows Kait riding her way through a storm in the middle of a desert before crashing and coming face to face with a Swarm enemy. The version of The Chain used in the trailer isn't the same that Fleetwood performed, but is instead a cover by Evanescence's Amy Lee. Previews When to Expect Our Gears 5 Review and Our Impressions So Far Read More This trailer's arrival actually coincides with the release of Gears 5, which should become available later tonight. The video is set to debut tonight during a commercial break of the NFL's season opener between the Packers and Bears. After the trailer plays, Gears 5 will then go live worldwide for those who have purchased the Ultimate Edition of the game. So if you're trying to hop into some Gears 5 tonight, keep an eye out for when this commercial plays during the football game. You can check out the new launch video down below if you'd like. Gears 5 is set to hit Xbox One and PC, with the standard edition releasing next week on September 10. Keep an eye out in the coming days for our own review of the game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Electronic_Arts,Acquisitions by Electronic Arts,"Electronic Arts is a company that is an American developer, marketer, publisher, and distributor of computer and video games, that was founded in 1982. Products of the company include EA Sports franchises, Sims, and other titles on both handheld and home gaming consoles. Electronic Arts often acquires new companies to expand or add to new product lines. For instance, EA chairman and chief executive officer Larry Probst said after the acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile that ""we intend to build a leading global position in the [...] business of providing games on mobile phones"". EA followed through with this later, making the company into EA Mobile, and allowing people to purchase and download content produced by them directly onto their phones. After the acquisition of Origin Systems, some staff in that company claimed that Electronic Arts initially gave them more resources, but allowed little latitude if employees made a mistake, and in some cases no longer trusted them, and even worked against them. EA has shut down entire companies or the studios thereof after acquiring them, including  the studio DICE Canada, Origin Systems, EA Chicago (NuFX), and Pandemic Studios. Gaming blogger Brian Crecente has said that fears that EA doesn't care about the quality of their products after they are acquired are debatable. As of February 2015, Electronic Arts' largest acquisition is the purchase of VG Holding Corp., the then-owner of video game developers BioWare and Pandemic Studios, for $775 million. Of the 39 companies acquired by EA, 20 are based in the U.S., five in the United Kingdom, six in Continental Europe, and eight elsewhere. Some of these companies or their respective studios, however, are now defunct. Of the six companies which EA purchased a stake in, two remaining companies are based in the U.S., while three other U.S. companies are defunct. After acquiring a 19.9% stake in France-based Ubisoft in 2004, EA sold a remaining 14.8% stake in it in 2010. Each acquisition listed is for the entire company, unless otherwise noted. The acquisition date listed is the date of the agreement between Electronic Arts (EA) and the subject of the acquisition. Unless otherwise noted, the value of each acquisition is listed in U.S. dollars, because EA is headquartered in the U.S. If the value of the acquisition is not listed, then it is undisclosed. If the EA service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed. According to data from Pitch Book via VentureBeat, the company has spent about $2.9 Billion on its 10 biggest acquisitions since 1992 Key Acquisitions Stakes",General,0.509798,"[['Date','Company','Business','Country','Value (USD)','Derived Studios','Derived Studios']['1987','Batteries Included†','Hardware and software developer','CAN','—','—','—']['July 1, 1991','Distinctive Software Inc.','Video game developer','CAN','—','EA Vancouver','EA Vancouver']['September 10, 1992','Origin Systems†','Science fiction space sim & Fantasy role-playing game developer','USA','$35,000,000','—','—']['November 14, 1994','DROsoft','Software distributor','ESP','—','—','—']['January 6, 1995','Bullfrog Productions†','Video game developer','UK','—','—','—']['March 8, 1995','Kingsoft GmbH†','Software distributor','GER','—','—','—']['January 29, 1996','Manley & Associates','Video game developer','USA','—','EA Seattle','EA Seattle']['June 4, 1997','Maxis','Video game developer and publisher','USA','$125,000,000','Maxis','Maxis']['April 2, 1998','Tiburon Entertainment','Video game developer','USA','—','EA Tiburon','EA Tiburon']['April 8, 1998','Vision Software','Software distributor','RSA','—','Vision Software','Vision Software']['July 28, 1998','ABC Software','Software distributor','CH','—','ABC Software','ABC Software']['August 17, 1998','Westwood Studios; Virgin Interactives North American Operations, Burst Studios†','Computer and video game developers','USA','$122,500,000','EA Pacific†','EA Pacific†']['September 8, 1999','PlayNation','Developer of online entertainment','USA','—','PlayNation','PlayNation']['November 22, 1999','Kesmai†','Video game developer and online game publisher','USA','—','Kesmai','Kesmai']['February 24, 2000','DreamWorks Interactive','Video game developer','USA','—','Danger Close Games†','Danger Close Games†']['February 28, 2001','Pogo.com','Family games website','USA','—','Pogo.com','Pogo.com']['June 11, 2002','Black Box Games†','Sports and racing video game developer','CAN','—','Quicklime Games†','Quicklime Games†']['October 16, 2003','Studio 33','Racing video game developer','UK','—','EA Northwest','EA Northwest']['February 13, 2004','NuFX','Sports video game developer','USA','—','EA Chicago†','EA Chicago†']['July 28, 2004','Criterion Software','Video game developer','UK','—','Criterion Software','Criterion Software']['July 27, 2005','Hypnotix','Video game developer','USA','—','—','—']['December 8, 2005','JAMDAT Mobile','Mobile entertainment developer','USA','$680,000,000','EA Mobile','EA Mobile']['July 20, 2006','Mythic Entertainment','Computer game developer','USA','—','EA Mythic†','EA Mythic†']['August 23, 2006','Phenomic Game Development','Real-time strategy game developer','GER','—','EA Phenomic†','EA Phenomic†']['October 2, 2006','Digital Illusions CE (DICE)','Video game developer','SWE','—','EA DICE','EA DICE']['November 30, 2006','Headgate Studios','Video game developer','USA','—','EA Salt Lake†','EA Salt Lake†']['February 12, 2007','SingShot Media','Social network service','USA','—','Sims on Stage','Sims on Stage']['October 5, 2007','Super Computer International','Computer software developer','USA','—','—','—']['October 11, 2007','VG Holding Corp.','Holding company of video game developers','USA','$775,000,000','BioWare','Pandemic Studios†']['May 21, 2008','Hands-On Mobile','Mobile video game developer and publisher','ROK','—','EA Mobile Korea','EA Mobile Korea']['June 3, 2008','ThreeSF','Social network service','USA','—','—','—']['December 2, 2008','J2MSoft','Computer game developer','ROK','—','—','—']['Q1 Fiscal 2010','J2Play','Social network service','CAN','—','—','—']['November 9, 2009','Playfish†','Social network game developer','UK','$400,000,000','—','—']['October 20, 2010','Chillingo','Mobile video game publisher','UK','$20,000,000','—','—']['May 3, 2011','Mobile Post Production','Mobile video game developer and publisher','USA','—','—','—']['May 4, 2011','Firemint','Mobile video game developer and publisher','AUS','—','—','—']['July 12, 2011','PopCap Games','Video game developer and publisher','USA','$750,000,000','San Francisco & Seattle','Dublin† & Vancouver†']['June 1, 2012','ESN','Social gaming product developers','SWE','—','—','—']['December 1, 2017','Respawn Entertainment','Video game developer','USA','$315,000,000','—','—']['May 1, 2018','GameFly','Game streaming','USA','','—','—']['July 9, 2018','Industrial Toys','Mobile video game developer','USA','','—','—']]",Date|Company|Business|Country|Value (USD)|Derived Studios|Derived Studios

Goal has the answer... The one fixture we have all been waiting for since their respective arrivals in Manchester is almost here as Jose Mourinho's Manchester United take on Pep Guardiola's Manchester City on Saturday. Mourinho and Guardiola are regarded as the two finest coaches in football today, having swept up major honours galore between them in recent years. And the two rivals will face off at Old Trafford this weekend when United play hosts to City, with both sides having made unbeaten starts to the Premier League season under their new managers. But who has won the most trophies between the pair of them? Well, Goal has the answer... After all that, who comes out on top? The answer is Mourinho, who has bagged an incredible 23 trophies in his career so far. But are Guardiola's 21 trophies worth just a little bit more overall?

The instrument, dating from 1731, was made by Antonio Stradivari, considered the greatest violin-maker of all time, and is one of just 600 in the world. The violin is one of the highlights of the sale from the estate of Huguette Clark, the eccentric heiress to a copper fortune, who owned sprawling Manhattan apartments and palatial homes but chose to spend her final decades living in a New York hospital where she died in 2011 at the age of 104. Download the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines Download now After she died, the violin was found in a closet, where it had been for 25 years. “Our pre-sale estimate on this is $7.5 million (£4.5 million) to $10 million (£6 million),” Kerry Keane, head musical instrument specialist at Christie's, which is hosting the sealed-bid auction, told NBC. The violin came into the possession of Ms Clark via her parents, copper magnate and politician William A. Clark and his wife Anna. “There is a spectacular telegram that her parents sent her in Paris in 1920 that told her...when they were sailing and when they would be arriving in New York, and that her mother had just bought her, quote unquote, the most fabulous violin in the world,” Mr Keane said. The instrument is known as the Kreutzer Stradivari, after its first-owner, Rodolphe Kreutzer. “Kreutzer owned and played his namesake Stradivari from about 1795 until his death in 1831,” Christie's said in a statement. The highest price paid for a Stradivarius violin is $16 million (£9.5 million). A rare viola made by the Italian artisan Antonio Stradivari in 1719 that will be sold by Sotheby's in a sealed bid auction in June is valued at $45 million (£27 million).

With not even a glimpse of him – or a confirmation of who is playing him – we're still wondering what his presence will be in the film, and if any other Wonder Woman villains will appear. Diana isn't exactly known for her villains compared to Batman or Superman, but the ones she has are often terrifying and fierce, with ancient grudges or twisted powers to match their rivalry. Here are the ten best Wonder Woman villains of all time.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_CEOs_of_Fortune_500_companies,Women CEOs of Fortune 500 companies,"This is a list of Women CEOs of the Fortune 500, based on the magazine's 2019 list.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2017/12/13/rohit-sharma-makes-history-third-odi-double-century-india-put,Rohit Sharma makes history with third ODI double century as India put Sri Lanka to the sword,"ndia batsman Rohit Sharma has scored his third ODI double century - all the more remarkable considering no other batsman in the world has more than one. In the second one-day international against Sri Lanka - which India need to win to keep the three-game series alive - Sharma took the visitor's bowling attack apart, posting an unbeaten 208 off just 153 balls in India's team total of 392-4. It was an incredible example of power hitting in perfect batting conditions. In fact, so frenetic was the pace of the final third of Rohit's innings, he scored more than half of his unbeaten double ton in the last 10 overs. And nobody is likely to come close to matching his three double centuries in a hurry. Martin Guptill (237*), Virender Sehwag (219), Chris Gayle (215) and Sachin Tendulkar (200*) are the only other batsmen to hit ODI double hundreds. Still only 30, this was Rohit's 16th ODI century, taking him past Sehwag to fourth place in India's all-time centurion list. Tendulkar (49), Virat Kohli (32) and Sourav Ganguly (22) make up the top three. It was in November 2013 that Rohit posted his first double ton, blowing away Australia with 209 off 158 balls. A year later, against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, he smashed the highest score in ODI history - 264 off 173 balls. Shikhar Darwan (68) and Shreyas Iyer (88) also contributed big scores today, but nobody could match Rohit's demolition job. Beleaguered Sri Lankan paceman Nuwan Pradeep even came close to Australian pace bowler Mick Lewis' record of most runs conceded in an ODI, finishing seven runs short with 10-0-106-0.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_Indian_films,Highest-grossing Indian films,"This is a ranking of the highest grossing Indian films which includes films from various languages based on the conservative global box office estimates as reported by reputable sources. There is no official tracking of domestic box office figures within India, and Indian sites publishing data are frequently pressured to increase their domestic box office estimates. Indian films have been screened in markets around the world since the early 20th century. As of 2003, there are markets in over 90 countries where films from India are screened. During the first decade of the 21st century, there was a steady rise in the ticket price, a tripling in the number of theaters and an increase in the number of prints of a film being released, which led to a large increase in the box office collections. The majority of highest-grossing Indian films are Bollywood (Hindi) films. As of 2014, Bollywood represents 43% of the net box office revenue in India, while Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36%, and other regional industries constitute 21%.

https://earthsky.org/space/what-is-the-most-distant-man-made-object-from-earth,What's the most distant human object from Earth?,"The most distant human-made object is the spacecraft Voyager 1, which – in late February 2018 – is over 13 billion miles (21 billion km) from Earth. Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched 16 days apart in 1977. Both spacecraft flew by Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also flew by Uranus and Neptune. Now both Voyagers are heading out of our solar system, into the space between the stars. Voyager 1 officially became the first earthly craft to leave the solar system, crossing the heliopause, in 2012. Both Voyager spacecraft were designed back in the early 1970s. They were built to take advantage of a rare grouping of planets on a single side of the sun in our solar system. This grouping, which happens only every 176 years, let the Voyagers slingshot from one planet to the next, via gravitational assists The Voyagers began acquiring images of Jupiter in January 1979. Voyager 1 completed its Jupiter encounter in early April of that year. Voyager 2 picked up the baton in late April and its encounter continued into August. The two spacecraft took more than 33,000 pictures of Jupiter and its five major satellites. And then the Voyagers went further. When they were launched, no spacecraft had gone as far as Saturn, which is 10 times as far as Earth's distance from the sun. The four-year journey to Saturn was thus a major leap, with the Voyagers arriving at Saturn nine months apart, in November 1980 and August 1981. Voyager 1 then began leaving the solar system, and Voyager 2 went on to an encounter with Uranus in January 1986 and with Neptune in August 1989. Ed Stone – who was Project Scientist for the Voyager mission – told EarthSky some years ago: We built the spacecraft with enough redundancy – that is, backup systems – so that they could keep going. And keep going they did! The Voyagers have now been traveling for 41 years. In 2017, astronomers described using the Hubble Space Telescope to look along the Voyagers' paths. In about 40,000 years, long after both spacecraft are no longer operational, Voyager 1 will pass within 1.6 light-years of the star Gliese 445, in the constellation Camelopardalis. Meanwhile, Voyager 2 is about 10.5 billion miles (17 billion km) from Earth. Voyager 2 will pass 1.7 light-years from the star Ross 248 in about 40,000 years. Bottom line: Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched 16 days apart in 1977. Voyager 1 is now the most distant spacecraft from Earth.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_eclipses_in_the_21st_century,Solar eclipses in the 21st century,"During the 21st century, there will be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central, in the sense that the very center (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the earth (for more information see gamma). In the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. At this point, the longest duration in which the moon completely covered the sun, known as totality, was during the solar eclipse of July 22, 2009. This total solar eclipse had a maximum duration of 6 minutes and 38.86 seconds. The longest possible duration of a total solar eclipse is 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The longest annular solar eclipse of the 21st century took place on January 15, 2010, with a duration of 11 minutes and 7.8 seconds. The maximum possible duration is 12 minutes and 29 seconds. The eclipse of May 20, 2050, will be the second hybrid eclipse in the span of less than one year, the first one being on November 25, 2049. The table contains the date and time of the greatest eclipse (in dynamical time, which in this case is the time when the axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest to the centre of Earth; this is in (Ephemeris Time). The number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, annular, partial or hybrid).

https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/ranking-all-20-seasons-of-kobe-bryant-career-from-best-to-worst,"Ranking all 20 seasons of Kobe Bryant's career, from best to worst","From the young kid with a 'fro wearing a No. 8 jersey to the crafty vet wearing 24 and hellbent on winning a sixth ring, we look back at Kobe Bryant's storied career and rank every season he's played in the NBA. We start with Kobe's most dominant season… This was Kobe at his athletic peak, and really the first season he had a reliable 3-point shot in his arsenal. He shot 38% from deep and threw down 116 dunks over the course of the season — the only time he hit triple digits in his career. He also grabbed a career-high 6.9 rebounds per game and averaged 5.9 assists. In the playoffs, Bryant actually raised his game, bumping his scoring output up to 32.1 points a contest. This was also the season Kobe tied Michael Jordan's record with nine consecutive 40-point games. Here he is scoring 51 points in only 31 minutes.

Phil Jackson returned to the Lakers bench just in time for Kobe's greatest scoring season. He averaged a career-best 35.4 points a game. That season also included the 81-point game against the Raptors: Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

The 2005-06 season was the perfect cross-section of the ultra-athletic Kobe and the wily veteran Kobe. He was simply unguardable. The trade for Pau Gasol turned the Lakers into championship contenders once again, and Kobe continued his statistical dominance, averaging 28.3 points per game. Los Angeles would fall to the Celtics in the NBA Finals, but Bryant won his first and only MVP trophy. This may have been the most satisfying season of Kobe's career, as he led the Lakers to their first NBA title since Shaquille O'Neal's departure. There were plenty of individual accomplishments as well. He won his first Finals MVP, his third All-Star Game MVP and set a Madison Square Garden scoring record with a 61-point outburst. The year Kobe won his second ring was the first year he really ascended to an elite level. He landed on the All-NBA second team after averaging 28.5 points per game. The Lakers lost only one playoff game on their way to another NBA title. Kobe changed his number from 8 to 24, but his scoring output remained strong. He scored 50-plus points in four consecutive games and had 10 total 50-point games in the regular season. Wilt Chamberlain is the only other player to pull that off. Kobe made the All-NBA first team for the first time in his career and also took home his first All-Star Game MVP award. His scoring average dropped by three points from the prior season but he shot a career-best 46.9% from the field. The Lakers finished off their three-peat with a sweep of the Nets. This was the last time we really saw a dominant Kobe Bryant. He averaged 27.3 points on 46% shooting and became the youngest player to pass the 30,000-point mark. It was also the season Dwight Howard joined the team, which was an unmitigated disaster. Bryant's season ended with a ruptured achilles in April. The Lakers won a second consecutive title, as Kobe won another Finals MVP, and he cemented himself as the league's best player in the clutch. Bryant knocked down six game-winners throughout the season. Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

This was also the season that gave us the most underrated moment of Kobe's career: Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video. The Lakers missed the playoffs for the first time in Kobe's career. Bryant finished second in scoring but was dropped from the All-NBA team for the first time in three seasons. In the offseason preceding the 2003-04 campaign, Bryant was arrested and charged with the sexual assault. He was forced to miss some games due to court appearances but the Lakers were able to make the NBA Finals. Kobe averaged 24 points a game and made a third straight All-NBA team. This was the only season from 2004 to 2013 that Bryant averaged fewer than 26 points a game, and the Lakers were swept out of the second round of the playoffs by the Mavericks. Bryant won his fourth All-Star Game MVP, tying Bob Pettit for the most all-time. Kobe hadn't yet hit his prime, but he was starting to show signs of the player he would become. He made his first All-Defensive team and averaged more than 20 points for the first time in his career. The Lakers steamrolled through the postseason and Bryant won his first ring. Kobe put up another monster scoring season but his efficiency really took a hit. He shot just 43%, his worst shooting season since 1997-98. Bryant missed out on the scoring title by just 38 points after sitting out the season finale. The strike-shortened season was Kobe's first as a full-time starter. Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones were traded away, opening a spot in the starting lineup for the 20-year-old Bryant. He averaged 19.9 points a game on 46.5% shooting before signing a six-year, $70 million contract extension. Kobe made only one start in his second season (he made six in his rookie year) but played a more prominent role off the bench. He averaged 15.4 points a game and made his first All-star team. We also got the best dunk of Bryant's career in a preseason game against the Wizards. Kobe averaged just 15 minutes a game in his first NBA season, but he did win the Slam Dunk Contest which keeps this season out his bottom-3.

Bryant suffered through an injury-plagued season and the Lakers missed the playoffs for the second time in Kobe's career. He did pass Michael Jordan on the NBA's all-time scoring list, so the season wasn't a total bust. Kobe's last season has been his least efficient campaign. He's shooting a career-worst 35.4% but still jacking up over 16 shots a game. The Lakers' 65 losses are the most since Kobe joined the team. This was a lost season for Kobe. He played in only six games and averaged a career-low 13.8 points per game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age,Presidents of the United States by age,"This is a list of presidents of the United States by age. The first table charts the age of each United States president at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the president is still living, their lifespan is calculated up to January 6, 2020. The second table includes those presidents who had the distinction among their peers of being the oldest living president, and charts both when they became and ceased to be the oldest living. Age of presidents The median age upon accession to the presidency is 55 years and 3 months. This is how old Lyndon B. Johnson was at the time of his first inauguration. The youngest person to assume the presidency was Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded to the office at the age of 42 years, 322 days after the assassination of William McKinley (the youngest to become president after having been elected was John F. Kennedy, who was 43 years, 236 days of age on Inauguration Day). The oldest person to be elected to a first term was Donald Trump, who became president at the age of 70 years, 220 days. Assassinated three years into his term, John F. Kennedy was the youngest at the time of his departure from office (46 years, 177 days); the youngest president to leave office at the conclusion of a normal transition was Theodore Roosevelt (50 years, 128 days). The oldest at the time of leaving office was Ronald Reagan (77 years, 349 days). The president born after the greatest number of their successors is John F. Kennedy. He was born after four of his successors: Lyndon Johnson (8 years, 9 months, and 2 days); Ronald Reagan (6 years, 3 months, and 23 days); Richard Nixon (4 years, 4 months, and 16 days); and Gerald Ford (3 years, 10 months, and 15 days). On the other extreme, Ronald Reagan was born before four of his predecessors: Richard Nixon (1 year, 11 months, and 7 days); Gerald Ford (2 years, 5 months, and 8 days); John F. Kennedy (6 years, 3 months, and 23 days); and Jimmy Carter (13 years, 7 months, and 25 days). The oldest living U.S. president is Jimmy Carter, born October 1, 1924 (age 95 years, 97 days). On March 22, 2019, he also became the nation's longest-lived president, surpassing the lifespan of George H. W. Bush, who died at the age of 94 years, 171 days. Additionally, Carter has the distinction of having the longest post-presidency in U.S. history, currently at 38 years, 351 days. The youngest living president is Barack Obama, born August 4, 1961 (age 58 years, 155 days). The shortest-lived president to have died by natural causes (thereby excluding John F. Kennedy and James A. Garfield, who were both assassinated) was James K. Polk, who died of cholera at the age of 53 years, 225 days; only 103 days after leaving office. Six U.S. presidents have lived into their 90s. The first to do so, John Adams, held the distinction of being the longest-lived president for nearly two centuries, from 1803 until Ronald Reagan surpassed his lifespan in October 2001. The six nonagenarian presidents (ordered by lifespan) are: Presidential age-related data points Oldest living Of the 44 people who have served as president, 24 have become the oldest such individual of their time, with one, William Howard Taft, doing so twice. Herbert Hoover held the distinction for the longest period of any, from the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933 until his own death 31 years later. Lyndon B. Johnson held it for the shortest, from the death of Harry S. Truman in December 1972 until his own death only 27 days later. Theodore Roosevelt, at age 49, is the youngest individual to become the oldest living president; Jimmy Carter became the oldest to acquire the distinction at age 94. (Nine of these individuals have also had the distinction of being the oldest living U.S. vice president: John Adams, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush.) On three occasions the oldest living president lost the distinction not by his death, but by the inauguration of a president who was older: Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) to William Howard Taft (born 1857) in 1909; Taft to Woodrow Wilson (born 1856) in 1913 (though Taft later regained the honor, as he outlived Wilson); and Richard Nixon (born 1913) to Ronald Reagan (born 1911) in 1981. Eleven presidents have held the distinction while in office. In the cases of George Washington, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Ronald Reagan this occurred upon their inauguration as they were older than their living predecessors (or, in Washington's case, had no predecessors). In the cases of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon, this happened at the same time as their becoming the only living president; in the cases of Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Harrison, the only other living president at the time was a younger predecessor, John Quincy Adams and Grover Cleveland respectively. By contrast, the president who acquired the distinction furthest from his time in office was Jimmy Carter, who had been retired for 37 years, 314 days. Note * Green text and an asterisk mark the inauguration date of a president older than any living ex-president. Other dates are the deaths of the then-oldest president.",,0.607198,"[['#','President','Born','Age at start of presidency','Age at end of presidency','Post-presidency timespan','Lifespan','Lifespan']['#','President','Born','Age at start of presidency','Age at end of presidency','Post-presidency timespan','Died','Age']['1','George Washington','Feb 22, 1732','57 years, 67 days; Apr 30, 1789','65 years, 10 days; Mar 4, 1797','2 years, 285 days','Dec 14, 1799','67 years, 295 days']['2','John Adams','Oct 30, 1735','61 years, 125 days; Mar 4, 1797','65 years, 125 days; Mar 4, 1801','25 years, 122 days','Jul 4, 1826','90 years, 247 days']['3','Thomas Jefferson','Apr 13, 1743','57 years, 325 days; Mar 4, 1801','65 years, 325 days; Mar 4, 1809','17 years, 122 days','Jul 4, 1826','83 years, 82 days']['4','James Madison','Mar 16, 1751','57 years, 353 days; Mar 4, 1809','65 years, 353 days; Mar 4, 1817','19 years, 116 days','Jun 28, 1836','85 years, 104 days']['5','James Monroe','Apr 28, 1758','58 years, 310 days; Mar 4, 1817','66 years, 310 days; Mar 4, 1825','6 years, 122 days','Jul 4, 1831','73 years, 67 days']['6','John Quincy Adams','Jul 11, 1767','57 years, 236 days; Mar 4, 1825','61 years, 236 days; Mar 4, 1829','18 years, 356 days','Feb 23, 1848','80 years, 227 days']['7','Andrew Jackson','Mar 15, 1767','61 years, 354 days; Mar 4, 1829','69 years, 354 days; Mar 4, 1837','8 years, 96 days','Jun 8, 1845','78 years, 85 days']['8','Martin Van Buren','Dec 5, 1782','54 years, 89 days; Mar 4, 1837','58 years, 89 days; Mar 4, 1841','21 years, 142 days','Jul 24, 1862','79 years, 231 days']['9','William Henry Harrison','Feb 9, 1773','68 years, 23 days; Mar 4, 1841','68 years, 54 days; Apr 4, 1841','0 days','Apr 4, 1841','68 years, 54 days']['10','John Tyler','Mar 29, 1790','51 years, 6 days; Apr 4, 1841','54 years, 340 days; Mar 4, 1845','16 years, 320 days','Jan 18, 1862','71 years, 295 days']['11','James K.

https://heavy.com/sports/2019/07/shane-lowry-nationality-irish-winners-british-open,Shane Lowry Nationality: How Many Irishmen Have Won British Open?,"Shane Lowry of Ireland entered the third round of the British Open tied with JB Holmes at 8-under par. Several other contenders were within a few strokes, including a pair of Englishman in Lee Westwood and Tommy Fleetwood. The 32-year-old Lowry rocketed past the competition with a course record 8-under 63, placing him four strokes ahead of Fleetwood for the lead entering the final day at Royal Portrush. This means he is 18 holes away from his first major championship. “I just felt so comfortable out there and hope I do tomorrow,” he told the Telegraph. “I have a tough 24 hours ahead of me, but there's nowhere I would rather be. I have a four-shot lead in an Open in Ireland. Tomorrow is going to be incredible no matter what happens.” If he holds onto the lead on Sunday, Lowry would be the second golfer from the Republic of Ireland to win the Open Championship. Padraig Harrington won two in a row in 2007 and 2008. In addition, three Northern Irish golfers have claimed the Claret Jug. Rory McIlroy won in 2014 at Royal Liverpool, as did Darren Clarke in 2011 at Royal St. George's. Fred Daly also won at Liverpool in 1947. Lowry's Irish heritage is a very visible part of his brand. He sports Bank of Ireland apparel, and his reddish-brown beard is one of his more distinguishable features. Great day out at @TheOpen finishing with Irish favourite Shane Lowry having a stormer. #hangontomorrow #golow lots for NSB golfers to learn from today. Great scenes. pic.twitter.com/QbRAPznguv — NSB Sport (@NSBSport) July 20, 2019 Lowry was born in Clara, County Offaly, Ireland. Clara is located in central Ireland along the Brosna River. Lowry honed his skills at the Esker Hills Golf Club, where he began his amateur career. He won the 2007 Irish Amateur Close Champion, then took the 2009 Irish Open while still an amateur. He attended University College Dublin and eventually turned pro in 2009. If he can win at Royal Portrush, which is located about a half-hour southeast of Belfast in Northern Ireland, it would hold special significance for the local audience. As Michael Bamberger at Golf.com states, the reason it took 68 years for the British Open to return to Portrush was due to the civil strife between the Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants. The real importance has everything to do with The Troubles, the euphemistic name for the war that divided Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants, Irish citizens in the north and Irish citizens in the south. The resounding cheering that greeted Lowry, a son of greater Dublin, received on Saturday for every birdie he made meant several things: I. People like him. II. To the fans gathered here, a golfer from Ireland is to be celebrated, without reservation, no matter what part of the island nation he comes from. III. The Troubles belong to yesterday. This weekend has seen several examples of Irish golfers earning praise. Clarke was the first to tee off on Thursday, which led to an emotional reaction from Northern Irishman, as well as the crowd. In addition, McIlroy earned several big cheers for his excellent second round, which still managed to fall short of the cut due to a dreadful start. Point being, many of the local at Royal Portrush are pulling for Lowry, even if he's Irish rather than Northern Irish.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom,Countries that have gained independence from the United Kingdom,"Below are lists of the countries and territories formerly ruled or administered by the United Kingdom or part of the British Empire, with their independence days.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39999096,Election 2017: How election results are calculated and reported by the BBC,"Key questions about general election results, and how the BBC reports them, are answered below. By winning more seats in the House of Commons than all the other parties put together. If a party does that, it has what is known as a majority. There are 650 seats available, which means 326 seats are needed to win an overall majority. However, an effective majority could be smaller as the Speaker and his deputies, although MPs, do not usually vote. Also, Sinn Fein, which won four seats in Northern Ireland in 2015, traditionally refuses to swear allegiance to the Queen, and is not entitled to vote as a consequence. Also called a seat, in a general election, this is where the political battles are fought. Voters in each constituency choose just one MP. No. But a reduction in the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and changes to some constituency boundaries was proposed in September 2016 and is now under public consultation. Final proposals are expected to be made in 2018. The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election as Speaker in his, or her, constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker however some parties, such as UKIP and the Green Party do. The current Speaker, John Bercow, is standing for election in Buckingham. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Mr Bercow is no longer a member of the Conservative Party as he was before his election to the role (by parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Mr Bercow's seat is regarded as being a Conservative constituency, as he won it for the party in 1997, 2001 and 2005 before being elected speaker. If Mr Bercow wins again, the result in Buckingham will be described as ""Speaker hold"" - and his seat will be added to the Conservative total. The BBC follows the same principle at every general election. What matters most is how many ""seats"" each party wins, and for things to change political parties need to win seats from each other. Because winning seats from each other is so important, a special language is used to show this. Seats that are won can mainly fall into two categories: hold or gain. Clearly these are really important to the opposition parties. If they are to form a new government, they need to win seats from the existing government and other parties to make ""gains"", while they retain or ""hold"" all the seats they had last time. By-elections are one-off elections in seats where, for example, the sitting MP has stood down or died. There have been 10 by-elections since 2015. When the BBC reports general election results, all of these interim by-elections are ignored, to allow for straightforward comparison with 2015's seats. The BBC uses slightly different terminology to describe results where seats have changed hands in by-elections. For example: in 2016 Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney won Richmond Park from Conservative Zac Goldsmith. If Zac Goldsmith regains the seat on 8 June, the result will be described as a ""Conservative Win"". It will not appear as a net gain in the Conservatives' overall UK seat tally. However, if an entirely different party wins a by-election seat, that result will be described as a ""gain"" from whichever party won the seat in 2015. The BBC adopts this policy in recognition of the very particular circumstances which often shape the outcome of by-elections. Comparing seat change from 2015 represents a fairer way of representing how the political expression of voters has altered from general election to general election. To win an election, a party must win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government. To do that simply one party needs to get one more seat than all the others added together. That is called an overall majority, but in the shorthand language of elections it is just called a majority. There are 650 seats in Parliament, so to get one more than everyone else put together a party must get 326 or more to get a ""majority"". Of course it makes things much easier for a government if they have many more MPs than all the others put together. That number is called the size of the majority. So, if one party were to win 326 seats, then all the other parties added together would be 324. The majority is therefore 326 minus 324: two. So the smallest majority possible is not one seat but two. Another quick way of working this out is to take away 325 from the number of seats that the winning party has got and double the result. For example: If the winning party has 350 seats what is the majority? 350-325=25 25x2=50 So the majority is 50. A tip for any office sweepstake on the size of the majority is never bet on an odd number. A hung parliament happens when no single party wins a majority. A party can stay in power without an absolute majority by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create a coalition government. Alternatively, it can aim to reach agreements with smaller parties to support it in parliament in the event of a confidence motion aimed at bringing down the government. Another possibility is for the biggest party to form a minority government with no agreements with other parties, and just try to form majorities in favour of each individual bill as it comes up - an arrangement sometimes called confidence and supply. If no party is prepared to go down one of these paths then parliament will be dissolved again and there will be another election. The general election in 2010 ended in a hung parliament, with the Conservatives the largest party. After negotiation, a coalition government was formed between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. An exit poll is conducted by approaching voters as they leave polling stations and asking them to fill in a mock ballot paper to indicate how they have just voted. The exit poll is carried out by polling companies GfK and Ipsos Mori for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. The results of the exit poll will allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won. When polls close at 22:00 BST, the BBC will broadcast the results of the exit poll. The projected seats for the top five parties based on the exit poll will be displayed in the summary graphic as grey bars. When the first results are declared, around an hour later, parties will begin to be ordered left to right by number of seats won at that time. As the night progresses, the summary results graphic will always display the top five parties according to seats won. All other parties' seats will be amalgamated into ""Others"". Full results are always available via the link to the results homepage, which contains a listings and breakdown of seats, votes and vote share by party. When all results are known, the summary graphic will conclude by displaying the top five parties by seats won in the new Parliament. In the event of a tie in the top five - eg two parties have two seats - the party with the most votes will be named. There are no seat predictions available for parties in Northern Ireland, as the exit poll is carried out in Great Britain (GB) only. To appear as a named party in either the overall UK scoreboard or a nation scoreboard, a party must fulfil one of the following criteria: All parties which do not meet these criteria are amalgamated into a group called Others. An aggregated tally of votes for the 191 independent candidates is also shown on the main UK scoreboard. Each constituency page will always name every party and independent standing in that constituency. The BBC only recognises parties which are registered as political parties by the Electoral Commission. On election night, the BBC calculates percentage turnout by dividing the number of valid votes cast for all candidates by the number of people eligible to vote (known as the electorate) Spoilt or rejected ballots are not included. The UK and nations turnout figures update through the night, based on electorates divided by valid votes of all constituencies declared so far. Why does the postcode search not give the result I expect? The postcode search box uses the latest available data supplied by Ordnance Survey. Discrepancies can occasionally occur when a postcode search returns a different constituency to the one given on polling cards sent to an address at the same postcode. Normally the constituencies concerned are next to each other, and it appears these discrepancies occur when postcodes are on the border between the two constituencies. We would advise people affected to follow the information on their polling card in terms of the constituency they are in and the polling place to be used on 8 June.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest,Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest,"Fifty-two countries have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since it started in 1956. Winners of the contest have come from twenty-seven of these countries. The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (also known as EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition. Participation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU. To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, or be in a Council of Europe member country. Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the ""Euro"" in ""Eurovision"", nor does it have a direct connection with the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus, and Armenia, in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone; and Australia making a debut in the 2015 contest. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The Persian Gulf state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition. However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest. Australia, where the contest has been broadcast since the 1970s, has participated every year since making its debut in 2015. The number of countries participating each year has grown steadily, from seven in 1956 to over twenty in the late 1980s. A record 43 countries participated in 2008, 2011 and 2018. As the number of contestants has risen, preliminary competitions and relegation have been introduced, to ensure that as many countries as possible get the chance to compete. In 1993, a preliminary show, Kvalifikacija za Millstreet (""Qualification for Millstreet""), was held to select three Eastern European countries to compete for the first time at the main Contest. After the 1993 Contest, a relegation rule was introduced; the six lowest-placed countries in the contest would not compete in the following year. In 1996, a new system was introduced. Audiotapes of all twenty-nine entrants were submitted to national juries. The twenty-two highest-placed songs after the juries voted reached the contest. Norway, as the host country, was given a bye to the final. From 1997 to 2001 a system was used whereby the countries with the lowest average scores over the previous five years were relegated. Countries could not be relegated for more than one year. The relegation system used in 1994 and 1995 was reused between 2001 and 2003. In 2004, a semi-final was introduced. The ten highest-placed countries in the previous year's Contest qualified for the final, along with the ""Big Four"": the largest financial contributors to the EBU. All other countries entered the semi-final. Ten countries qualified from the semi, leaving a final of twenty-four. Since 2008, two semi-finals are held with all countries, except the host country and the Big Four, participating in one of the semi-finals. Some countries, such as Germany, France, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have entered most years, while Morocco has only entered once. Two countries, Tunisia and Lebanon, have attempted to enter the contest but withdrew before making a début. Liechtenstein, a country without an eligible television service, tried unsuccessfully to enter in 1976. Participants The following table lists the countries that have participated in the contest at least once. Shading indicates countries that have withdrawn from the contest. Morocco participated in the contest once, in 1980. Luxembourg, one of the original seven participants, has not been seen at the contest since 1993. Italy withdrew from the contest in 1997 and returned in 2011. Slovakia previously competed three times between 1994 and 1998, failing to break into the top ten, but returned in 2009. Monaco returned to the contest in 2004, after over two decades out of the contest. However, the country failed to advance from the semi-final with each of its first three entries post-return and withdrew after the 2006 contest. Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro were both dissolved, in 1991 and 2006 respectively. Serbia and Montenegro participated in the 1992 Contest as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which consisted of only the two republics. Both Montenegro and Serbia have competed as separate countries since 2007. Table key  Inactive – Countries who have participated in the past, but did not participate in the most recent contest.  Former – Former countries that have been dissolved. Participating countries in the decades The table lists the participating countries in each decade since the first Eurovision Song Contest was held in 1956. Seven countries participated in the first contest. Since then, the number of entries has increased steadily. In 1961, 3 countries debuted, Finland, Spain and Yugoslavia, joining the 13 already included. Yugoslavia will become the only socialist country to participate in the following three decades. In 1970, a Nordic-led boycott of the contest reduced the number of countries entering to twelve. By the late 1980s, over twenty countries had become standard. In 1993, the collapse of the USSR in Eastern Europe gave many new countries the opportunity to compete. Three countries—Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of them former Yugoslav republics—won through from a pre-qualifier to compete. After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more Eastern European countries to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994. In 2003, three countries applied to make their debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 in an attempt to prevent situations like this. The Union set a limit of forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held for the first time in 2008. Table key Winner – The country won the Eurovision Song Contest that year.  Second place – The country was ranked second that year.  Third place – The country was ranked third that year.  Remaining places – The country placed from fourth to second last this year.  Last – The country was ranked last that year.  Non-qualified – The country did not qualify to the final (2004–present).  Non-qualified for the contest – The country did not qualify from the pre-qualifying round (1993, 1996)  Undecided – The country has confirmed participation for the next Eurovision Song Contest, however, the competition has not yet taken place.  Debutant – The country made its debut during the decade.  Did not participate – The country did not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest that year.  Disqualified or withdrawn – The country was going to participate in the Eurovision that year, but was disqualified or withdrew that year. A cross (X) means that the country participated in the contest that year. 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s Unsuccessful attempts to participate There have been several unsuccessful attempts to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. For broadcasters to participate, they must be a member of the EBU and register their intention to compete before the deadline specified in the rules of that year's event. Each participating broadcaster pays a fee towards the organisation of the contest. Should a country withdraw from the contest after the deadline, they will still need to pay these fees, and may also incur a fine or temporary ban. China China aired the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and then Chinese provincial television channel Hunan Television had confirmed its interest in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. The EBU had responded saying ""we are open and are always looking for new elements in each Eurovision Song Contest"". However, on 3 June 2015, the EBU denied that China would participate as a guest or full participant in 2016. During the Chinese broadcast of the first 2018 semi-final on Mango TV, both Albania and Ireland were edited out of the show, along with their snippets in the recap of all 19 entries. Albania was skipped due to a ban that took effect in January 2018 prohibiting showing on television performers with tattoos while Ireland was censored due to its representation of a homosexual couple on-stage. In addition, the LGBT flag and tattoos on other performers were also blurred out from the broadcast. As a result, the EBU has terminated its partnership with Mango TV, citing that censorship ""is not in line with the EBU's values of universality and inclusivity and its proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music,"" which led to a ban on televising the second semi-final and the grand final in the country. A spokesperson for the broadcaster's parent company Hunan TV said they ""weren't aware"" of the edits made to the programme. Faroe Islands Since 2010, the Faroese national broadcaster Kringvarp Føroya (KVF) has been attempting to gain EBU membership and thus participate independently in the Eurovision Song Contest. However, KVF cannot obtain EBU membership due to the islands being a constituent part of the Kingdom of Denmark as determined by the unity of the Realm. In late 2018, the Faroese national broadcaster Kringvarp Føroya showed renewed interest in joining the European Broadcasting Union and participating in the Eurovision Song Contest. According to the broadcaster, they are not excluded by the rule that only independent nations can join, and as a result the Faroese broadcaster started internal discussions on applying for the EBU membership and participating in the Eurovision Song Contest and even hosting a national final similar to the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. Kazakhstan Kazakhstan has never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest. Kazakhstan is negotiating to join the European Broadcasting Union. The state television company (K-1) has been hoping for pending or approved EBU membership since 2008. If this happens, they may be eligible to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. Nevertheless, they have broadcast the Eurovision Song Contests from 2010 onwards. However, according to the EBU, no Kazakh broadcaster has ever formally applied to join the EBU. On 18 December 2015, it was announced that Khabar Agency, a major media outlet in Kazakhstan, had been accepted into the EBU as an Associate member, but were still not eligible to take part in the contest under the current rules. Only countries who are part of the European Broadcasting Area are eligible to participate, with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. On 22 December 2017, Channel 31 announced that they plan to debut in the 2019 contest, due to their newfound EBU membership. They debuted at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018 alongside Wales, placing sixth. On 30 July 2018, the EBU stated that the decision to invite Kazakhstan was made solely by the Junior Eurovision reference group, and there were no current plans to invite associate members other than Australia. On 22 November 2018, Jon Ola Sand said in a press conference that ""we need to discuss if we can invite our associate member Kazakhstan to take part in adult ESC in the future, but this is part of a broader discussion in the EBU and I hope we can get back to you on this issue later."" However, shortly after he clarified that they would not have an entry in the 2019 edition. Kosovo Kosovo has never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest on its own, but the contest has had a long history within the country which has broadcast it since 1961, and after the start of Kosovo's UN administration, the Kosovan public broadcaster RTK has been independently licensed by the EBU to broadcast all three shows. Despite not having participated at the song contest, Kosovo did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011. As Kosovo is not part of the United Nations and RTK not part of the International Telecommunication Union, RTK cannot apply to become a full member of the EBU. Jugovizija, the national pre-selection of Yugoslavia organised by the Yugoslav broadcaster Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT) since 1961 and it featured entries submitted by the subnational public broadcasting centres based in the capitals of each of the constituent republics and autonomous provinces. Each of them had its own regional jury. SAP Kosovo was represented by RTV Priština, but their entry has never won. Jugovizija 1986 was organised by RTV Priština. Before 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, Viktorija a singer from Vučitrn represented Yugoslavia as part of Aska in 1982 and Nevena Božović from Mitrovica represented Serbia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007. After the break-up of Yugoslavia, numerous Kosovo Albanian singers participated at the Festivali i Këngës which is the Albanian national selection for Eurovision organised by RTSH. The most notable participants to date were Rona Nishliu who represented Albania in the Eurovision 2012 and Lindita who represented Albania in the Eurovision 2017. Some singers, especially Kosovo Serbs, participate in Serbian national selection organised by RTS. Nevena Božović also represented Serbia as a member of Moje 3 in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 and as a solo artist in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. After Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, its broadcaster Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) applied for EBU membership, and wished to enter Kosovo into Eurovision Song Contest 2009. There is a co-operation agreement signed between the EBU and RTK and the EBU supports the membership of RTK. From 2013 on, RTK has observer status within the EBU and did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011. According to the Kosovan newspaper Koha Ditore, a possible entry would be selected via a national final called Akordet e Kosovës, a former pop show that had been taken off the air some years ago. Lebanon Lebanon has never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest. The country's broadcasting organisation, Télé Liban, was set to make the country's debut at the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 with the song ""Quand tout s'enfuit"" performed by Aline Lahoud, but withdrew due to Lebanon's laws barring the broadcast of Israeli content. Liechtenstein Liechtenstein has never participated at the Eurovision Song Contest, but the contest has had a long history within the country, with at least one attempt to participate being made by the principality. Liechtensteiners have had the opportunity to watch the contest on Swiss, Austrian or German television. The country has made attempts to participate in the contest in the past: in 1976 a Liechtenstein entry was selected to compete in the contest – Biggi Bachman and ""Little Cowboy"" would have been the country's first entry had there been a national broadcaster, but as there was none in the country the entry was rejected from competing. On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, licensed by Liechtenstein's government, became the first broadcaster based in Liechtenstein. This would allow the country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, should they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced that they were not interested in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time because they had no budget for membership. In July 2009, the broadcaster officially announced its intent to apply to join the EBU by the end of July, with the intent of taking part at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, to be held in Oslo, Norway. Peter Kölbel, managing director of 1FLTV, officially confirmed the broadcaster's interest, revealing that they had plans to develop a national final similar to Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German version of the Idol series. In November 2009, 1FLTV decided to postpone EBU and Eurovision plans, due to financial reasons began to search for other options for funding EBU membership in the future. 1FLTV submitted its application for EBU membership on 29 July 2010. If accepted, 1FLTV would have gained full EBU membership and would have been able to send an entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. However, Liechtenstein did not appear on the official list of participants for Eurovision 2011. In late 2012 it was announced by Peter Kölbel of 1FLTV that Liechtenstein would not be able to take part till 2013 at the earliest. They had been trying to get government subsidies since 2010 to enable participation, participation was likely if in April 2012 the Government approved funding. On 10 September 2013, 1FLTV informed and confirmed to Esctoday.com that Liechtenstein would not be participating at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The broadcaster has no plans to join the EBU at the moment. This was confirmed again on 28 July 2014 in the run-up to the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Austria. 1FLTV did however state their interest in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest, but that they have to evaluate the costs of EBU membership, a necessary prelude to participation. 1FLTV confirmed that the nation will not be able to make its début in 2016, due to lack of funds to join the EBU. On 21 September 2016, 1FLTV announced that they would not be able to debut to the contest in 2017, but that they would set their eyes on a future participation once they overcome their financial hurdles. Yet again, on 1 September 2017 they also announced they would not debut at the 2018 contest in Lisbon. On 4 November 2017 the broadcaster confirmed that it was planning to debut in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019 and would organise a national selection to select both the singer and the song. However, on 20 July 2018, the EBU stated that 1 FL TV have not applied for membership. Qatar Qatar Radio (QR) is currently an associate member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), while all competing countries of the Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the Union. The broadcaster first revealed on 12 May 2009 that they were interested in becoming active members of the Union, which would allow the nation to compete in the Contest. Qatar Radio has stated that they hope to join Eurovision by 2011. Qatar first became involved in the Contest at the 2009 edition, where the broadcaster sent a delegation to the contest and broadcast a weekly radio show called '12pointsqatar' dedicated to Eurovision, which received favourable responses and has initiated the further involvement of Qatar in Eurovision. Qatar Radio has said that they feel that they would be happy to join all other competitors in the contest, including Israel if Qatar receives a membership. Qatar is required to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU in order to have a chance to take part, as Qatar Radio is only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership, with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation (QGBTC). If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then they would be able to air the contest alongside the television broadcast. Scotland The Scottish National Party (SNP) has campaigned for a place in Eurovision for Scotland but had been rejected numerous times because Scotland is represented as a part of the British entry and is represented by the BBC. On 11 February 2008 the EBU stated that a Scottish broadcaster could apply for EBU membership, but under the current rules could not enter the Eurovision Song Contest as the BBC currently has exclusive rights to represent the entire United Kingdom. Scotland would have been eligible to enter the contest had Scotland gained independence as a result of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, as Scotland would, therefore, have been a separate country. On 25 November 2013, the Scottish Government released a referendum blueprint which detailed plans for the transfer of BBC Scotland into the Scottish Broadcasting Service (SBS) and joining the EBU, as well as partaking in competitions, including Scottish entries in the Eurovision Song Contest. Had the referendum vote been favour of independence, then the earliest that Scotland would be eligible to debut would have been 2017. However, the referendum result on 18 September 2014 was to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the aforementioned BBC retains exclusive rights to represent the United Kingdom, including Scotland. On 18 December 2018, it was announced that the Scottish Gaelic branch of the BBC, BBC Alba would debut at the Eurovision Choir of the Year in 2019 which was held in Gothenburg, Sweden. However, they did not progess beyond the semi-final. This was the first time Scotland has competed separately from the United Kingdom in a Eurovision event. Soviet Union The Soviet Union never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest, but it made several attempts in the late 1980s. In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for the Soviet Union, brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due to the number of political reforms made by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the Soviet Union would impact on the relationships between the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries of the west. Valery Leontyev was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving. Some former republics of the Soviet Union, which were geographically situated in Europe, would later compete in the contest on their own in the 1990s and 2000s: Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, except Kazakhstan, with five of the countries going on to win one of the contests: Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Russia, and Azerbaijan. Ukraine was the first ex-USSR country to win twice. Tunisia Tunisia attempted to enter the 1977 edition of the contest and was scheduled fourth in the running order, however, prior to selecting an act, the country withdrew for undisclosed reasons. It is believed that Tunisia's member broadcaster, Établissement de la radiodiffusion-télévision tunisienne (ERTT), did not want to compete with Israel. In 2007, ERTT clarified that it would not participate in the contest in the foreseeable future due to governmental requests. Wales In the 1960s, the late Welsh singer, scholar and writer Meredydd Evans proposed that Wales should have its own entry in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1969, Cân i Gymru was launched by BBC Cymru Wales as a selection show for the contest, with songs to be performed in Welsh. However, it was decided that the BBC would continue to send one entry for the whole of the United Kingdom. Despite this, Cân i Gymru has been broadcast every year since, with the exception of 1973. The winning song takes part in the annual Pan Celtic Festival in Ireland. Wales has appeared as an independent country in another EBU production, Jeux Sans Frontières and Welsh national broadcaster S4C has been encouraged to take part in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Wales is also eligible to take part in minority language song contest Liet-Lávlut but has so far shown no interest. Wales participated in the inaugural Eurovision Choir of the Year in 2017, where they finished 2nd. Wales announced on 9 May 2018 that they would debut at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Minsk, Belarus. They finished in last place with 29 points. Non-participants Four countries—Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, and Libya—have broadcasters that are members of both the EBU and the Arab States Broadcasting Union. Although they could participate, it is believed that they refuse to do so due to the ongoing participation of Israel. Vatican City could participate through its member broadcaster Vatican Radio (RV), which was also a founding member of the EBU, but has not due to RV only broadcasting papal events. It is believed that RV might refuse to participate due to the church's condemning of homosexuality, which is often endorsed by the contest. Broadcast in non-participating countries The contest has been broadcast in several countries that do not compete, such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and China. Since 2000, it has been broadcast online via the Eurovision website.",,0.257572,"[['Country','2000','2001','2002','2003','2004','2005','2006','2007','2008','2009']['Albania','','','','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Andorra','','','','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Armenia','','','','','','','X','X','X','X']['Austria','X','','X','X','X','X','','X','','']['Azerbaijan','','','','','','','','','X','X']['Belarus','','','','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Belgium','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Bosnia and Herzegovina','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Bulgaria','','','','','','X','X','X','X','X']['Croatia','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Cyprus','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Czech Republic','','','','','','','','X','X','X']['Denmark','X','X','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Estonia','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Finland','X','','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['France','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Georgia','','','','','','','','X','X','X']['Germany','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Greece','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Hungary','','','','','','X','','X','X','X']['Iceland','X','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Ireland','X','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Israel','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Latvia','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Lithuania','','X','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Macedonia','X','','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Malta','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Moldova','','','','','','X','X','X','X','X']['Monaco','','','','','X','X','X','','','']['Montenegro','','','','','','','','X','X','X']['Netherlands','X','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Norway','X','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Poland','','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Portugal','','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Romania','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Russia','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['San Marino','','','','','','','','','X','']['Serbia','','','','','','','','X','X','X']['Serbia and Montenegro','','','','','X','X','X','','','']['Slovakia','','','','','','','','','','X']['Slovenia','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Spain','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Sweden','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Switzerland','X','','X','','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Turkey','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['Ukraine','','','','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']['United Kingdom','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X']]",Country|2000|2001|2002|2003|2004|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171107005391/en/IKEA-Strengthens-Distribution-Network-Customer-Fulfillment-Centers,"IKEA Strengthens Distribution Network with Customer Fulfillment Centers in Baytown, TX and American Canyon, CA","CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IKEA today announced it has leased additional warehouse space as customer fulfillment centers to complement its network of five regional distribution centers currently supporting its 45 US stores. These two leased facilities in Baytown, TX and American Canyon, CA will focus on delivering items to customers who order products online or purchase larger items at a store. Each project will create approximately 200 jobs. “As we expand across the country and grow our online presence, we want to ensure we have sufficient warehouse capacity to support the efficient and timely delivery and shipment of products to our customers,” said Lars Petersson, IKEA US president. “Our goal is to increase accessibility to the IKEA product selection, and these two fulfillment centers will help us meet the home furnishing needs of many American customers.” In Baytown, the 1,000,000-square-foot leased space comprised of two buildings is located in the Cedar Port Industrial Park, 30 miles east of downtown Houston, and became operational earlier this year. This project represents the fourth IKEA location (three current stores and three more underway) in Texas. In American Canyon, the 646,000-square-foot leased facility is part of Napa Logistics Park developed by DivcoWest and Orchard Partners, located 34 miles north of the Port of Oakland, and will be operational in early 2018. This project represents the tenth IKEA location (eight stores and a regional distribution center) in the state of California. With nearly 1,000 suppliers in 50 countries, IKEA traditionally transports products globally to its stores through regional distribution centers. These two fulfillment centers and others in the future will augment the current US distribution strategy and enhance the ability of IKEA to ensure product availability to customers shopping in-store or online. About IKEA Since its 1943 founding in Sweden, IKEA has offered home furnishings of good design and function at low prices so the majority of people can afford them. There are currently more than 400 IKEA stores in 49 countries, including 45 in the US, where there are five regional distribution centers and one more under construction. IKEA incorporates sustainability into day-to-day business and supports initiatives that benefit children and the environment.

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is defined as a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been ""incorporated"" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated and so an ""incorporated place"" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township. The other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below. Incorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile The following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2010 U.S. Census, except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state, and ranked by total population; the population density for each place is also given in the lists. The population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles; the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below. The list below only includes incorporated places of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below. The District of Columbia would be included in the list, but Washington, D.C. misses the 10,000 mark as it has a population density of 9,800 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census (as of 2013 American Community Survey estimates, however, Washington now has a density of 10,528 people per square mile). Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Census-designated places The following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if it was included in the above table of incorporated places. New York City boroughs The following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000 but it is included for comparative purposes. Puerto Rico The following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census. The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or municipio, the place is located in is also included in the table below. The municipalities are what is thought of as ""incorporated places"" in Puerto Rico because there are no subordinate governments within them, only eight electoral districts which hold no administrative functions (the electoral districts are what generally constitute the census-designated places in this list below). No municipalities have a density over 10,000 as of the 2000 U.S. Census; the San Juan Municipio is the densest at 9,084.4 people per square mile. The Jayuya municipality is not part of any metropolitan area as it is only part of the Jayuya micropolitan area (see Puerto Rico census statistical areas). The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Northern Mariana Islands In the Northern Mariana Islands, there is one place that has more than 10,000 people per square mile: China Town, Northern Mariana Islands (in the 2010 U.S. Census). The other non-Puerto Rico U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) do not have any places with more than 10,000 people per square mile (as of the 2010 U.S. Census). China Town, Northern Mariana Islands is a Census-Designated Place; it is also a village within the larger municipality of Saipan. China Town would rank 105th if it were in the first table above. List of incorporated cities in the United States with over 75,000 residents Below is a list of the most densely populated cities in the United States which have a population density over 10,000 people per square mile and have a total population of over 75,000 according to the 2010 Census. This list relates to the first list, but excludes cities under 75,000.  Those cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold. Distributions The following distributions only include the 125 incorporated places with population densities over 10,000 people per square mile. They do not include the 36 census-designated places, the boroughs of New York City, or the 11 places in Puerto Rico with densities over 10,000. Metropolitan areas The following ranks United States metropolitan areas by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 within them. If two or more metropolitan areas have the same number of incorporated places, as is the case of the eight metros with one place, the metro areas are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the metro area. States and territories The following ranks the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 inhabited U.S. territories by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 people within them. The ""10,000+ places"" column only includes incorporated places, it does not include census-designated places (CDPs). If two or more states have the same number of places, as is the case of the 36 states that contain no incorporated places with a density over 10,000, the states are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the state. The density figures for the densest incorporated place within each state and territory are from the 2010 United States Census, and all the data for this ranking is from the U.S. Census Bureau. The first rank column ranks each state by the number of 10,000+ places in that state (New Jersey ranks first, California ranks second, etc.) The second rank column ranks the most densely populated place in each state or territory (Guttenberg, NJ ranks first, Kaser, NY ranks second, etc.) Hawaii officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the city of Honolulu is coextensive with Honolulu County, which makes up the whole island of Oahu. When the U.S. Census Bureau ranks incorporated places by population, it usually includes the Honolulu census-designated place, which is the urban center of Honolulu, in its ranking of incorporated places. Therefore, for this list of the densest incorporated places by state, the Honolulu CDP is considered the densest incorporated place in Hawaii. The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories are also included in this list. Puerto Rico also officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the lowest form of local government in Puerto Rico are the municipios, which are equivalent to counties. For this ranking, the municipios are counted as the incorporated places in Puerto Rico, and the San Juan Municipio is the densest. In American Samoa, each village is governed by a pulenu'u (the equivalent of a mayor) — as such, each village in American Samoa can be considered to be incorporated for the purposes of the table below. In the Northern Mariana Islands, each municipality (such as Saipan) is governed by a mayor, and so those municipalities can be considered incorporated — the villages in the Northern Mariana Islands are considered Census-Designated Places. In Guam, each village is governed by a mayor, and so those villages can be considered incorporated. For the purposes of the table below, the major towns of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Charlotte Amalie, Frederiksted and Christiansted) are considered to be incorporated. Note: this table contains data from the 2010 U.S. Census — because of this, data is more than 9 years old, and the current population density of each jurisdiction may have changed since then. Populations New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia are the only incorporated places in the United States that have a population over 1,000,000 and a population density over 10,000 people per square mile.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1480245,IMF economist Dr Reza Baqir appointed SBP governor for 3 years,"President Arif Alvi has approved the appointment of Dr Reza Baqir, a long-time economist with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for a period of three years, a notification issued by the Finance Division said on Saturday. The senior economist of Pakistani origin will replace Tariq Bajwa, who was unexpectedly removed from the post on Friday along with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman. A notification said the federal government in pursuance of a federal cabinet decision had accepted the resignation tendered by Bajwa as the central bank's governor on May 03 ""with immediate effect"". ""The President of Pakistan is pleased to appoint Dr Reza Baqir as Governor State Bank of Pakistan for a period of three years from the date he assumes office,"" a subsequent notification read. It said the terms and conditions of his appointment will be notified later with the president's approval. The IMF website lists Dr Baqir as the Fund's current Senior Resident Representative for Arab Republic of Egypt. It wasn't immediately clear whether he would relinquish his post at the global lender before taking charge of the SBP governor office. He had previously served as the Head of Mission for Romania at the IMF following his appointment in January 2016, according to the Centre for Economic Research in Pakistan. As per his executive profile posted by Bloomberg, Dr Baqir has been with the IMF since 2000 as the head of the Debt Policy Division. A graduate of Harvard University, he later obtained a PhD in economics at the University of California, Berkeley. The new SBP governor has worked with the World Bank, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Union Bank of Switzerland. Tariq Bajwa had confirmed to Dawn on Friday that he was asked to resign while he was in Islamabad for talks with the IMF that are supposedly ""progressing"" according to prime minister's adviser on finance Hafeez Shaikh, who has recently replaced finance minister Asad Umar. But when asked if this change and the removal of the FBR chairman during the IMF talks might send a negative signal to the markets, Shaikh said: “I hope the markets are going to look at our actions and decide. They have to see the totality of the actions and our policies.” It was unclear how the change of such senior and important officers will affect the talks with the IMF. Both men seemed to have been taken by surprise, as FBR chairman Jahanzeb Khan was scheduling meetings for Saturday till late Friday night when the news of his departure flashed across news TV screens. Similarly, Bajwa was participating in what many consider the last leg of negotiations with IMF before the finalisation of a programme. Both Bajwa and Khan are Grade 22 officers of the Pakistan Administrative Service, though the former was appointed after his retirement. There was little indication in the days leading up to the removal about unhappiness with Bajwa's performance. However, about the FBR head, both former finance minister Umar and Prime Minister Imran Khan had given public statements expressing their disappointment over his performance. Sources in the finance ministry, who were privy to the developments, had told Dawn that the FBR chairman was viewed by PM Khan as ""a mediocre person"", lacking dynamism, and was held largely responsible for the lacklustre revenue performance since his appointment. The FBR is on course to register one of the highest shortfalls of its history by the close of this fiscal year, anticipated to come in above Rs350 billion. The sources said the recently appointed finance adviser agreed with the prime minister's views, and seemed to be moving to bring in his own team to manage the country's finances. Both the SBP governor and the FBR chairman are key players in any IMF programme. The governor is actually one of the signatories to any programme, and the FBR chairman is tasked with meeting the revenue target that usually lies at the heart of any programme.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age,Countries by median age,"This article is a list of countries by median age. Methodology Median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups - that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger to 40 or more in several European countries, Canada and Japan. The median age for women tends to be much greater than that of men in some of the ex-Soviet republics, while in the Global South the difference is far smaller or is reversed.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/05/the-7-top-selling-video-game-franchises-in-history.aspx,The 7 Top-Selling Video Game Franchises in History,"The video game industry is one of the largest forms of entertainment in the world, with annual revenue of $100 billion and growing. People spend as much time playing video games as they do on Netflix or social media. Among the top-selling games in history, you will find all the major game publishers represented -- Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO). Here are the top seven best-selling franchises of all-time: Electronic Arts' action racing franchise Need for Speed has had its ups and downs over the years. While the most recent version released in 2015 marked one of the lower points, longtime fans of the Fast and Furious-style racing game more likely savor Hot Pursuit in 2010 or High Stakes in 1999 as their favorite installment in the series. Despite most versions of the game receiving mediocre reviews, the franchise has still managed to sell 150 million units since its first release in 1994. Look for EA's next entry in the series by early 2018. Also published by Electronic Arts, the classic social simulation game The Sims has sold 175 million copies since 2000. Recent releases seem to have taken a downhill slide, which caused EA to shut down the studio responsible for creating the franchise. However, development of The Sims will continue. EA recently hinted that the next installment -- The Sims 5 -- will include virtual reality capabilities, which could create a new level of interest in the popular franchise. Take-Two Interactive has struck gold with the massively popular Grand Theft Auto franchise. It is very difficult across the entertainment industry to produce sequels that earn great reviews, whether it's a video game or a movie sequel. However, developer Rockstar Games has proven to have an uncanny ability to produce new versions of Grand Theft Auto that consistently draw high praise from critics. Each new version ends up as one of the best games for each console generation. Grand Theft Auto V has sold 75 million copies since its 2013 release, and still ranks as one of the top-selling console games after four years, which is phenomenal. Since the first Grand Theft Auto game released in 1997, all versions of the franchise combined have sold an impressive 240 million copies. Given the popularity of the first-person shooter genre, it's not surprising to see Call of Duty rank somewhere on this list. First released in 2003, the Call of Duty series has sold 250 million units. The latest installment's science-fiction setting disappointed fans of the franchise, but it still managed to outsell competitor Battlefield 1 from EA, which means even when Call of Duty is off its game, gamers still buy it. The Pokemon Company was started in 1998 by a joint investment of three companies, one of which was Nintendo (OTC:NTDOY). The Pokemon brand originated as a video game, but today it spans comics, animated movies, TV shows, merchandise, events, and official shops. The video game series has sold 280 million units life-to-date. The classic puzzle game Tetris was designed by Alexey Pajitnov while working for the Computer Center of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1984. The name Tetris comes from the Greek word ""tetra"" (meaning ""four"") and ""tennis,"" Pajitnov's favorite sport. The game was immediately popular in the Soviet Union and took off globally in the late 1980s, after the game was showcased at the 1988 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. After 495 million units sold, the game comes in as the second-best-selling video game of all time. Many of today's adult gamers were likely introduced to video games with the classic Mario game on the original Nintendo console in the late 1980s. Chances are if you missed Frogger on the Atari, you found Mario on Nintendo as one of your earliest and best gaming memories. Since the introduction of the Mario character in 1981, the franchise has sold 528.5 million copies. And Mario is not done. With the new Nintendo Switch expected to sell up to 20 million units in its first year after launch, there will be plenty of pent-up demand for the next generation of gamers to be introduced to Mario in the upcoming Super Mario Odyssey this holiday shopping season.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_software_companies,The largest software companies,"Many lists exist that provide an overview of large software companies, often called ""independent software vendors"" (""ISVs""), in the world. The lists differ by methodology of composition and consequently show substantial differences in both listed companies and ranking of those companies. Legend Forbes Global 2000 The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine, based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets and market value. The Forbes list for software companies includes only pure play (or nearly pure play) software companies and excludes manufacturers, consumer electronics companies, conglomerates, IT consulting firms, and computer services companies even if they have large software divisions. For example, IBM would likely rank #3 in 2017 if its software business unit had been a separate company. The omission of more diversified firms can be useful to investors who are seeking either more or less exposure in the software sector.

He will be only the second chief minister of Maharashtra to achieve this feat. Maharashtra came into being in 1960 when the State of Bombay was split into two. Gujarat was the other state that was born. Twenty-six chief ministers have been sworn in Maharashtra in its nearly 60 years of existence with Sharad Pawar taking oath four times, Vasantrao Naik and Vasantdada Patil three times each, and Shankarrao Chavan and Vilasrao Deshmukh twice each. Before Devendra Fadnavis, Vasantrao Naik was the only Maharashtra chief minister to have completed his term in the third Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha (assembly) during 1967-72. Naik remains the longest serving chief minister of Maharashtra. Naik became chief minister in December 1963 for the first time. He was the third person to become chief minister in the second Vidhan Sabha of Maharashtra over a span of little over one year. He remained the Maharashtra chief minister for the next 11 years till 1975. Naik was replaced mid-way in the fourth Vidhan Sabha by Shankarrao Chavan. Shankarrao Chavan later served as the Union home minister under Rajiv Gandhi and PV Narasimha Rao. He also served as the Union finance minister in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet in the final one-and-a-half years of the term. His son Ashok Chavan also became the chief minister of Maharashtra when the Congress leadership decided to remove Vilasrao Deshmukh from the post after he courted controversy by visiting Mumbai terror attack sites with filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma in 2008. This was the second instance when Deshmukh missed the chance to complete a full tenure as Maharashtra chief minister. He had been replaced by Sushilkumar Shinde in 2003. Sharad Pawar, the powerful Maratha politician and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief, became Maharashtra chief minister four times - but never as an NCP legislator. His first stint as Maharashtra chief minister came in 1978, when he sided with the rebel faction of the Congress under Devraj Urs, the influential Karnataka politician. As Indian National Congress (Socialist) - alternatively called as Congress (Secular) - leader, Sharad Pawar engineered defections in the Patil government and walked away with 40 MLAs. He formed the government with the support of the Janata Party. Sharad Pawar was only 37 at the time and was the youngest chief minister of Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar's other three stints as Maharashtra chief minister came as a Congress MLA from his home turf of Baramati. He served as Maharashtra chief minister for little under five years across four terms and three Vidhan Sabhas. Barring Sharad Pawar's first tenure during 1978-80, the Congress had an uninterrupted reign in Maharashtra till 1995. During this period only AR Antulay held the dubious distinction of having been pushed out of the office after being convicted by the Bombay High Court in a case of extortion. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won the 1995 election that was held in the shadow of the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition in Uttar Pradesh, the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai and the communal riots in the state. The alliance had two chief ministers -- Manohar Joshi and Narayan Rane -- over the next five years. Joshi had to resign after a political uproar erupted over allegation that he favoured his son Girish Vyas's firm that was developing a housing complex in Pune. The Bombay High Court declared the housing complex illegal and Joshi resigned. The Congress returned to power in 1999 when a fresh election was held and remained in power till 2014 appointing five chief ministers during the period with Vilasrao Deshmukh being sworn in twice. Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the Maharashtra chief minister after the BJP emerged as the single largest party in 2014 assembly election. Later, it formed an alliance with the Shiv Sena.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_winners,FIFA World Cup winners,"This is a list of all teams, players and coaches who have won the FIFA World Cup tournament since its inception in 1930. By team The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different nations. Brazil has won the most titles, five. The current champion is France, who won the title in 2018. By year Participating teams have to register squads for the World Cup, which consisted of 22 players until 1998 and of 23 players from 2002 onwards. Since 1978, winners' medals are given to all members of the winning squads. Prior to that, only players who were on the pitch during the final matches received medals. FIFA decided in 2007 to retroactively award winners' medals to all members of the winning squads between 1930 and 1974. By player A total of 445 players have been in the winning team in the World Cup. Brazil's Pelé is the only one to have won three times, while another 20 have won twice. No player has won two World Cups both as captain. Italy's Giuseppe Meazza (1938), Brazil's Bellini (1958), Mauro (1962) and Cafu (2002), and Argentina's Daniel Passarella (1978) lifted the trophy once as captain, but were not captain for the other tournament they won. Argentina's Diego Maradona (1986, 1990) and Brazil's Dunga (1994, 1998) captained their sides in two final matches, but only won on their first occasions, while West Germany's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (1982, 1986) lost both final matches as captain. Brazil's Pelé and Vavá are the only two players to score in two final matches for winning teams. West Germany's Paul Breitner (1974, 1982) and France's Zinedine Zidane (1998, 2006) also scored in two final matches, but only won on their first occasions. Cafu is the only player to play in three final matches, 1994 (as a substitute), 1998 and 2002. Luis Monti is the only player to play in two final matches for different national teams. He appeared in the 1930 final for Argentina, who lost, and the 1934 final for Italy, who won. Attilio Demaría was also in Argentina's 1930 squad and Italy's 1934 squad, but appeared in neither final. Brazil's Mário Zagallo, having won in 1958 and 1962 as player, went on to win in 1970 as the head coach, becoming the first to win both as player and coach. West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer is the second, winning as both captain (1974) and coach (1990). Didier Deschamps is the third. He led the France team to win in 1998 as captain, and in 2018 as coach. Germany's Miroslav Klose is the only player to have won four World Cup medals: 2002 (silver), 2006, 2010 (both bronze) and 2014 (gold). By coach 20 different coaches have won the World Cup, Italy's Vittorio Pozzo being the only one to win twice. Four other coaches finished as winners once and runners-up once: West Germany's Helmut Schön (winner in 1974, runner-up in 1966) and Franz Beckenbauer (winner in 1990, runner-up in 1986), Argentina's Carlos Bilardo (winner in 1986, runner-up in 1990), and Brazil's Mário Zagallo (winner in 1970, runner-up in 1998). Zagallo (twice), Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps also won the title as players. All winning head coaches have been natives of the country they coached. Only two foreign coaches have reached the final match: George Raynor of England, with Sweden in 1958, and Ernst Happel of Austria, with the Netherlands in 1978.",Players who have won the World

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/225-years-and-counting--americas-longest-standing-treaty-of-peace-and-friendship----with-morocco-162850096.html,225 Years and Counting: America's longest standing Treaty of Peace and Friendship -- with Morocco,"WASHINGTON, July 18, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Today marks the 225 anniversary of the US Senate's 1787 vote to ratify what is now the longest standing treaty in America's history — the US-Morocco ""Treaty of Peace and Friendship."" More than two centuries later, the treaty continues to define the special and strategic relationship between two of the oldest and closest allies across the Atlantic. Formal relations between Morocco and the US began in 1777, when Morocco became the first country to recognize the American colonies as a nation. As George Washington and his troops took the field to make good on the Continental Congress' Declaration of Independence, the Sultan of Morocco, Mohammed III, granted American ships recognition and safe passage through the Straits of Gibraltar and in Moroccan ports. Negotiations began in 1783 on a formal treaty of commerce and friendship, which was signed in 1786 by John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. On July 18, 1787, Congress ratified the treaty, which set forth the framework for diplomatic relations, assurances of non-hostility, access to markets on ""most favored nation"" basis, and protection of US ships from attack by foreign vessels in Moroccan waters. As US President in 1789, George Washington wrote Mohammed III to thank him for Morocco's support: ""This young nation, just recovering from the waste and desolation of a long war, has not, as yet, had time to acquire riches by agriculture or commerce. But our soil is beautiful, and our people industrious, and we have reason to flatter ourselves that we shall gradually become useful to our friends… I shall not cease to promote every measure that may conduce to the friendship and harmony which so happily subsist between your empire and [the US]."" Since then, the 235-year Morocco-US relationship has continued to advance: During World War I, Morocco backed the Allied forces and Moroccan soldiers fought alongside US Marines in France; During World War II, Morocco hosted the Casablanca Conference in 1943 to plan Allied strategy in Europe; In 1963, Morocco was among the first countries to invite the Peace Corps to assist in development projects; Morocco is one of only 20 countries with a Free Trade Agreement with the US, signed in 2004; Morocco is also a steadfast ally against terrorism and continues to be an important leader for reform in the North Africa and Middle East region.

Methodology Median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups - that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger to 40 or more in several European countries, Canada and Japan. The median age for women tends to be much greater than that of men in some of the ex-Soviet republics, while in the Global South the difference is far smaller or is reversed.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/5013649/Natasha-Richardson-dies-after-skiing-accident-in-Canada.html,Natasha Richardson dies after skiing accident in Canada,"A statement from the family said: ""Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.” It came amid intense speculation about her condition, with suggestions she may have suffered a blood clot or from ""talk and die sydrome"". Actress Miss Richardson, 45, was flown from intensive care in Montreal to the Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, where her mother Ms Redgrave, 72, was pictured visiting. She suffered a head injury during a private ski lesson at the exclusive Mont Tremblant resort on Monday afternoon. Miss Richardson, who is married to actor Liam Neeson, fell during a lesson in which she was not wearing a helmet but initially showed no visible signs of injury. An hour later, she complained of a headache and was admitted to the Hospitalier Laurentien in nearby Ste-Agathe. She was later transferred to intensive care at the Sacre-Coeur Hospital 75 miles away in Montreal before being flown New York via private jet. She was accompanied by her husband, the Irish actor Mr Neeson, 56, who had been filming in Toronto. Miss Redgrave was in New York with the couple's sons, Michael, 13, and Daniel Jack, 12, who had been in Canada on the holiday. The Oscar-winning actress was pictured, red-eyed and visibly tearful, visiting the hospital last night. One doctor said she had most likely suffered from a blood clot on the brain, while another said her condition could be “talk and die syndrome”, where a person at first seems unharmed by an impact but later suffers a rapid collection of blood between the skull and the brain. One report from the New York Post claimed that Richardson was already “brain-dead”. However, the report was not confirmed by Richardson's spokesperson, and celebrity news website TMZ refuted it, citing “sources” as saying the actress was suffering from swelling in the brain. Richardson is the daughter of Miss Redgrave and the late director Tony Richardson. An award-winning actress in her own right, she is the granddaughter of Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, the sister of actress Joely Richardson, and the niece of Lynn Redgrave. Born in May 1963, Richardson was educated at St Paul's Girls School in London and trained at the city's Central School of Speech and Drama. She met Schindler's List star Neeson on the set of the film Nell and married him in 1994. Her extensive experience on stage includes a number of Shakespearean roles, among them Ophelia in Hamlet and Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 1986 she won the London Drama Critics' most promising newcomer award for her performance as Nina in The Seagull alongside her mother. She also won a Tony award for best actress in a musical for her performance as Sally Bowles in Sam Mendes' production of Cabaret on Broadway in 1998.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate,Countries by traffic-related death rate,"This list of countries by traffic-related death rate shows the annual number of road fatalities per capita per year, per number of motor vehicles, and per vehicle-km in some countries in the year the data was collected. According to the World Health Organization, road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.35 million deaths worldwide in the year 2016. That is, one person is killed every 25 seconds. Only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (seven percent of the world's population), have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drunk driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints). Over a third of road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income countries are among pedestrians and cyclists. However, less than 35 percent of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to protect these road users. The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100,000, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100,000. 74 percent of road traffic deaths occur in middle-income countries, which account for only 53 percent of the world's registered vehicles. In low-income countries it is even worse. Only one percent of the world's registered cars produce 16 percent of world's road traffic deaths. This indicates that these countries bear a disproportionately high burden of road traffic deaths relative to their level of motorization. There are large disparities in road traffic death rates between regions. The risk of dying as a result of a road traffic injury is highest in the African Region (26.6 per 100 000 population), and lowest in the European Region (9.3 per 100 000). Adults aged between 15 and 44 years account for 59 percent of global road traffic deaths. 77 percent of road deaths are males. The total fatalities figures comes from the WHO report (table A2, column point estimate, pp. 264–271) and are often an adjusted number of road traffic fatalities in order to reflect the different reporting and counting methods among the many countries (e.g., ""a death after how many days since accident event is still counted as a road fatality?"" (by international standard adjusted to a 30-day period), or ""to compensate for under-reporting in some countries"". List The table shows that the highest death tolls tend to be in African countries, and the lowest in European countries.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/29/a-boy-in-the-water-tom-gregory-review,A Boy in the Water by Tom Gregory review – the youngest English Channel swimmer,"In 1988, 11-year-old Gregory set a record that will never be broken. His book recalls the agonising swim and his charismatic coach n 1988, at the age of 11, Tom Gregory became the youngest person ever to swim the English Channel. It took him just under 12 hours to complete 32 miles, fuelled by tubes of tomato soup and the odd chocolate biscuit lobbed into the sea by his coach, John Bullet. Gregory writes that he trusted Bullet with his life; however, it is also clear he was terrified of letting him down This memoir is structured around Gregory's account of that swim, and he makes no bones about how horrendous it was. At various points he fell asleep, hallucinated, developed agonising shoulder and hip pain, and cried so much that his goggles filled with water. If you are thinking: “Who would put a young kid through an experience like that?” the answer is Bullet, a maverick coach who ran the swimming club in Eltham, south-east London. Bullet motivated his young proteges with equal parts eccentricity and charisma. Training involved gruelling sessions in the pool, followed by open-water swimming camps in Dover and the Lake District. They were fed tinned Spam and marrowfat peas, slept in leaky tents, and undertook challenges that would strike fear into the fittest adult. At the age of eight, Gregory was plunging into the icy sea by Dover harbour; at 10, he swam the length of Windermere, 11 miles long and colder than the Channel. After recent sex scandals involving sports coaches, this book makes uneasy reading. Gregory makes it clear that Bullet never overstepped the mark in a sexual sense (in a couple of scenes he applies grease all over Gregory's body, but pointedly leaves him to do his own crotch). However, the line between motivating a young person and emotionally manipulating them is not easy to draw. Bullet's “success” was down to his fanatical dedication. He seemingly had no family, and was secretive about his past, pouring all his tough-talking love into his young swimmers. Gregory writes that he trusted Bullet with his life; however, it is also clear that he was terrified of letting him down. Gregory was the last young swimmer to conquer the Channel – shortly afterwards, the Channel Swimming Association set a minimum age of 16. He tries to make the case here that this was a mistake; a tiresome product of our “risk-aware era”. I was left feeling that, on the contrary, it was the right decision. • A Boy in the Water is published by Penguin.

Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. But with your help we can continue to put it center stage. It will be a defining year and we're asking for your help as we prepare for 2020. Rampant disinformation, partisan news sources and social media's tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the American public in 2020. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater, and with your help we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight. Our journalism is free and open for all, but it's made possible thanks to the support we receive from readers like you across America in all 50 states. ""America is at a tipping point, finely balanced between truth and lies, hope and hate, civility and nastiness. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. As that choice nears, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, and with your continued support, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness."" – US editor, John Mulholland On the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the Guardian said, ""Perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence. It should have a soul of its own."" That is more true than ever. Freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders, the Guardian's editorial independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. We're asking our readers to help us raise $1.5m to support our rigorous journalism in the new year. Every contribution, big or small, will help us reach it. Make a gift from as little as $1.

http://epicstream.com/news/NobelleBorines/Star-Wars-The-Mandalorian-Possibly-Confirmed-Sabine-Wrens-Fate-After-Rebels,Star Wars: The Mandalorian Possibly Confirmed Sabine Wren's Fate After Rebels,"It's no secret that the final episode of The Mandalorian Season 1 was a lot to unload for Star Wars fans considering that it featured so many awesome Easter Eggs. For one, there were several references to the animated shows Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. Interestingly, these clues may have revealed what happened to Sabine Wren after all these years. In the season finale, Mando's real name was finally revealed to be Din Djarin (a detail that Pedro Pascal accidentally leaked before the show's premiere). In addition to that, fans got to see what truly happened to him when he was a child. In a flashback sequence, the young Djarin was actually saved by a Mandalorian fighter who is wearing the Death Watch sigil. The Death Watch was once an elite group of Mandalorian warriors who tried to take over their own planet although it appeared that they finally joined a united banner in Star Wars Rebels. This could mean that Sabine managed to restore peace on Mandalore and reinstate the Death Watch as a group that would serve their people. Interestingly, re-establishing the Death Watch isn't the only revelation about Sabine. In Rebels, she also happened to be in possession of the darksaber. However, The Mandalorian revealed that the weapon now belongs to Moff Gideon. It's best to remember that the only way to wield the darksaber is to defeat its previous owner. Does this mean that Gideon defeated Sabine before the events in The Mandalorian? Hopefully, we'll get some answers in the second season. Do you think Sabine's fate was revealed in The Mandalorian? Sound off in the comments below.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_filming_locations,Star Wars filming locations,"Multiple global locations were used for filming locations during the production of the Star Wars films to provide the setting for alien planets in the Star Wars Universe. Most locations were used to shoot principal photography with actors; more recently as digital filmmaking has become more common, some prequel trilogy locations were shot with no actors present and digitally composited into the films to provide a backdrop of a story setting. In addition to filming locations, a list of film studios is also included for reference.

https://fansided.com/2017/05/30/will-there-be-prison-break-season-6-fox,Will there be a Prison Break season 6 on FOX?,"Will there be a Prison Break season 6? We tell you whether or not Prison Break has been renewed for a sixth season by FOX. Will there be a Prison Break season 6 on FOX? Fans are waiting to hear whether or not FOX has renewed Prison Break for season 6 after bringing the popular series starring Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell back for season 5 this spring. FOX has made no official decision about Prison Break season 6, but the network is interested in more new episodes. Here's what network co-chair and CEO Dana Walden had to say about the show's future when FOX made its presentation at the upfronts earlier this month, per The Futon Critic: We would definitely consider doing more episodes. There's nothing in the works right now. Really what prompted us to do this last installment was [series creator] Paul Scheuring coming in to us with a great take on where these characters are and what a season might look like. I know they're thinking about it. It's definitely not something we want to do every season. We want to make it special. So at the point they come to us with another idea, it will be seriously considered. We actually loved this season and the characters are beloved. Would the actors consider coming back for season 6? Again, no one has officially made plans to return, but considering that the revival was a labor of love it's hard to imagine they wouldn't want to come back. Prison Break season 5 reunited Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell, Sarah Wayne Callies, Paul Adelstein, Rockmond Dunbar, Amaury Nolasco and Robert Knepper — the show's seven biggest stars — even though they had moved on to other projects like DC's Legends of Tomorrow and Colony. Robert Knepper, who plays Theodore “T-Bag” Bagwell, told us in our interview that he wanted to see how Prison Break season 5 did before talking about season 6: There's already rumblings of people saying well, what about a next chapter? What about a spinoff? I'm like, let's just do this one first and see how it goes. Season 5 has gone well for FOX. The first two episodes were both over 5 million total viewers (live plus DVR), and more recently, the show was still around the high 3 million total viewers level for its fifth and sixth episodes. So the network has incentive to consider more, and if the actors are able to come back, the question really is why not do a Prison Break season 6? Are you interested in another season of Prison Break? Tell us whether you'd watch Prison Break season 6 in the comments.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Running_Man_episodes_(2018),Running Man episodes (2018),This is a list of episodes of the South Korean variety show Running Man in 2018.

https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/lebrons-odds-of-catching-jordan,LeBron's Odds of Catching Jordan,"On Thursday, after LeBron James and the Miami Heat won their second consecutive NBA championship, I noted on Twitter that James was on the same pace as the Chicago Bulls great Michael Jordan. Both James and Jordan won their first championship at 27 and their second at 28, I wrote. Jordan went on to win four more NBA titles, for a total of six. My statement depended on a technicality, I later discovered: Jordan's biological age was 28 when he won his first championship, in 1991, and 29 when he won his second, in 1992. However, basketball statisticians generally define a player's age differently: by how old he was as of Feb. 1 of an NBA season, the rough midpoint of the basketball calendar. Jordan's birthday is Feb. 17. Those semantics aside, it is worth considering just how likely James might be to match or exceed Jordan's six titles. (From this point on, we'll use basketball statisticians' definition of age.) Players like Jordan and James are so rare that it can be risky to compare them with anyone. Still, one reasonably useful benchmark is to evaluate players who, like James and Jordan, had won at least one Most Valuable Player award and at least one NBA title as of their age-28 season, meaning that they had achieved the pinnacle of both individual and team success. By my count, there were 13 such players before James. On average, they won about two additional championships (more precisely, an average of 1.9) after their age-28 season. So a reasonable over-under line for James might be two more NBA titles, or four total. It is tough to say exactly what James's odds of catching Jordan might be, because the average conceals a wide range of outcomes among the individual players. Four of the players on the list — Magic Johnson, Moses Malone, Bob Pettit and Dave Cowens — never won another championship after their age-28 season. But four others — Jordan, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — won at least four more titles. James needs four more championships to catch Jordan, so one estimate of his odds might be 4 chances out of 13, or about 30 percent. But some of the favorable precedents, like Russell, came in an era when teams had far more ability to retain their players. Among the players on the list who played their age-28 season during the salary-cap era (since 1984-85), only Jordan won four or more titles. It seems safe to say that you would not want to bet on James at even money. There are just too many things that can go wrong with a player's career as he ages: injury or illness, early retirement, bad teammates or bad luck. Even this year's Heat began the season with only about a 30 percent chance of winning the title, according to the Las Vegas odds. That percentage roughly matches the historical likelihood of an NBA team's repeating as champion, which is 33 percent. So James's chances of winning a third title next season in Miami are probably about 1 in 3. After that, his chances begin to decline. For one thing, it is less certain that James will be surrounded by strong teammates. (James has the right to opt out of his contract after next season, and even if he stays in Miami, teammates like Dwyane Wade are already seeing their skills atrophy.) More important, players in team sports typically peak in skill in their mid- to late 20s, meaning that James's game may begin to wane. The NBA is a superstar's league, and if James goes from being MVP-caliber to mere All-Star within a few years, it will considerably hurt his odds of winning more titles. I have estimated a player's chances of winning an NBA title based on his win shares, a statistic calculated by Basketball-Reference.com that measures overall value to a team. Since the introduction of the salary cap in 1984-85, excluding the two regular seasons (1998-99 and 2011-12) that were shortened by labor disputes, the best player in the league in a given season has averaged about 18 win shares, which is a reasonably good match for James's performance over the last several years. The model estimates that such a player has about a 20 percent or 25 percent chance of winning the championship in today's NBA environment. What about the fifth-best player in the league — someone equivalent to the worst player on the All-NBA team? That player has averaged about 13 win shares, which translates to only about a 10 percent chance of winning the championship. The 10th-best player in the NBA at a given time has only about a 7 percent chance of winning a title, according to the model. And the 25th-best player — someone who might be the last reserve added to one of the conference All-Star teams — has about a 5 percent chance. That is not much better than an NBA player chosen at random, who has a 3.3 percent chance of becoming a champion by virtue of being on one of the 30 teams. A borderline All-Star in the NBA, in other words, is much closer to being a role player than a superstar, at least when it comes to his odds of winning a championship. James, of course, will have considerable freedom to pick his employer. If he puts winning titles above all other considerations, he could sign on for any role with the team he perceived as having the best chance to win the championship in a given season. Few players in NBA history have been willing to take things to quite that extreme. Instead, superstars expect teams to build around them — even if they are past their prime, and even if it means something as inglorious as Jordan's late years spent with the Washington Wizards. One can forgive Jordan, who did not have anything left to prove. But to match him, James will need to win two or three more titles over the next several seasons while he still plays at an MVP level, which will require good health and some good luck. Then he may need to chase the last couple of titles by being willing to play the right role with the right club.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_fatalities,Formula One fatalities,"This list of Formula One fatalities includes drivers who have died during a FIA World Championship event (including practice, qualifying and the race), and those who have died while driving modern or vintage Formula One cars outside the World Championship.  Track marshals and other race attendees who have died as a result of these accidents are not included in the list.  Fifty-two drivers have died from incidents that occurred at a FIA World Championship event or while driving a Formula One car at another event, with Cameron Earl being the first in 1952.  Thirty-two of the drivers died from incidents during Grand Prix race weekends which formed part of the World Championship, seven during test sessions and twelve during non-championship Formula One events.  The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has seen the most fatalities; seven drivers have died there during the time that the Indianapolis 500 formed part of the world championship.  Fifteen drivers died in the 1950s; fourteen in the 1960s; twelve in the 1970s; four in the 1980s and two in the 1990s.  Following the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola on consecutive days in 1994, there were no driver fatalities caused during world championship events for more than 20 years until Jules Bianchi's death in 2015, from injuries sustained during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, although three drivers died in the intervening years while driving former Formula One cars (two from the 1960s, one from the 1990s) in vintage racing and other events not associated with World Championship Grands Prix. Two Formula One Champions have died while racing or practising in Formula One, Jochen Rindt in 1970, and Senna in 1994.  Rindt is the only driver to have won the championship posthumously.

https://money.cnn.com/2016/01/27/pf/college/largest-college-endowments/index.html,America's 10 richest colleges,"The 10 richest colleges in the US have endowments of at least $10 billion. With $36.4 billion, Harvard has the largest endowment by far. But the average investment return for colleges and universities across the country took a big hit in 2015, falling to 2.4% from 15.5% the year before, according to a new report from the National Association of College and University Business Officers. It's not a complete surprise considering last year's weak market performance. And it's not as bad as 2012, when endowments averaged a loss of 0.3%. Related: Billionaire gives Harvard record $400 million gift But what's most concerning is that the disappointing year drags down the average 10-year return below what most colleges say they need to maintain, said William Jarvis, the executive director at the Commonfund Institute, an asset management firm that sponsored the report. That might lead colleges to use less money from their endowments each year. ""If we're now living in a low-return environment, the question that comes up is whether you need to adjust your spending rate downward,"" Jarvis said. On average, colleges spent about 4% of their endowment last year, which covered about 10% of their operating budget. Those with an endowment larger than $1 billion funded about 17% of spending, according to the report. Related: Stanford and Harvard got over $1 billion in donations Endowment investment allocations did not change much since the year before. On average, more than half of an endowment's assets are in alternative strategies -- like derivatives, hedge funds and private equity. For smaller endowments, the share of funds in these more risky investments is less. About 19% of assets are in international stocks and 16% are in domestic, across the board.

https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20771210/average-wage-is-expected-to-increase-to-above-1000-in-2018.html,"Average wage is expected to increase to above €1,000 in 2018","Wages in Slovakia keep increasing at a steady pace driven by the growing economy, lack of labour force and administrative measures of the third Robert Fico cabinet. Arguing that companies should share their good economic results with their employees, they are increasing the minimum wage and the surcharges for night, weekend and holiday work, as well as introducing voluntary summer holiday and Christmas bonuses, partly exempt from payroll taxes. “Today, as the labour minister, my first task is not only to reduce unemployment but to secure a sufficient labour force which is a much greater challenge,” said Labour Minister Ján Richter, adding that higher work surcharges should dissuade people from leaving Slovakia to work abroad. In spite of this, labour costs in Slovakia are still far below the EU average and will remain so for years even though their growth is faster than the EU average. The wage increase in 2017 was the biggest seen in the past seven years, based on data collected by the Platy.sk website. The basic gross wage, ie the wage without bonuses, rose by 6.6 percent compared to 2016, while the average basic monthly wage in 2017 amounted to €980 gross. In 2016, wages increased by 4.8 percent, while it was significantly less in 2013 and 2014, 1.8 percent each year. Basic wages have grown the most in the Nitra and Trnava Regions, up by more than 8 percent. The Košice Region followed with a 7.4 percent increase. The Bratislava Region reported the lowest increase of 5.1 percent, but this is because the average basic gross wage in this region is significantly higher than in others. It amounted to €1,336 for 2017 with the second highest rate of €982 in the Košice Region. The PwC PayWell 2017 study, based on the data from 300 companies across 17 sectors, also confirmed the strong growth in wages. “For 2017, the original forecast for wage and salary increase was 3.5 percent,” the study reads. “However, the actual increase was 3.9 percent.” Dynamic growth in the manufacturing sector was reflected by salary changes for the job position of production worker. “Compared to an increase of 5.3 percent between 2015 and 2016, the overall average year-to-year income increase was 9.5 percent,” points out the study. Firms in Slovakia plan to increase base wages and salaries by an average of 3.4 percent in 2018, which is a lower increase than planned for 2017, based on the study. Even though labour costs in Slovakia are increasing faster than the EU and eurozone average, they are still low compared with the older EU members. While labour costs amounted to €10.4 per hour in 2016 in Slovakia, an increase of 3.5 percent y/y, the EU28 average was €29.8, up 1.4 percent y/y, according to Eurostat. In the case of the eurozone, the average labour cost amounted to €25.4, up 1.6 percent y/y. What employers and economic analysts point out is that labour costs are increasing faster than productivity. “This means that the window where our labour force is still of interest within Europe is narrowing,” said Andrej Arady, analyst with the VÚB bank, adding that further growth of wages should be supported by higher growth in productivity. “It is necessary to focus on sectors with higher added value. Put simply, if this trend continues, assembly services will no longer be interesting to foreign investors in terms of price.” The Fico government keeps upping the minimum wage. After the social partners failed to agree on an increase for 2018, the government stepped in and increased it by €45 to €480 from the beginning of 2018. Fico would like to see the minimum wage at €520 or more in 2019.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films,Most expensive films,"Due to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides officially holds the record with a budget of $378.5 million, while The Hobbit trilogy stands as the most expensive back-to-back film production with combined costs of $623 million after tax credits. Inflation, filming techniques and external market forces affect the economics of film production. Costs rose steadily during the silent era with Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) setting a record that lasted well into the sound era. Television had an impact on rising costs in the 1950s and early 1960s as cinema competed with it for audiences, culminating in 1963 with Cleopatra; despite being the highest earning film of the year, Cleopatra did not earn back its costs on its original release. The 1990s saw two thresholds crossed, with True Lies costing $100 million in 1994 and Titanic costing $200 million in 1997, both directed by James Cameron. Since then it has become normal for a tent-pole feature from a major film studio to cost over $100 million and an increasing number of films are costing $200 million or more. This list contains only the films that are already released to the general public and no films that are still in production, post-production or just announced films, for the reason that these costs can change during the production process. Listed below is the net negative cost: the costs of the actual filming, not including promotional costs (i.e. advertisements, commercials, posters, etc.) and after accounting for tax subsidies. The charts are ordered by budgets officially acknowledged by the production companies where they are known; most companies will not give a statement on the actual production costs, only estimates by professional researchers and movie industry writers are available. Where budget estimates conflict, the productions are charted by lower-bound estimates. Most expensive productions (unadjusted for inflation) Only productions with a net budget in excess of a nominal value of $200 million in U.S. dollars are listed here. Due to the effects of inflation, all but one of the films on the chart have been produced in the 21st century. Films *  Officially acknowledged figure. Back-to-back film productions *  Officially acknowledged figure. Most expensive films (adjusted for inflation) The productions listed here have their nominal budgets adjusted for inflation using the United States Consumer Price Index taking the year of release. Charts adjusted for inflation are usually ordered differently, because they are dependent on the inflation measure used and the original budget estimate. The Soviet War and Peace, released in four parts across 1966 and 1967, is sometimes cited as the most expensive production ever: Soviet claims stating it cost $100 million (equivalent to $788 million in 2019 dollars) were circulated in the American press during its showing there. However, its financial records reveal it cost slightly more than $9 million (about $50–60 million in today's money). Another notable omission is Metropolis, the 1927 German film directed by Fritz Lang, often erroneously reported as having cost $200 million at the value of modern money. Metropolis cost $1.2–1.3 million at the time of its production, which would be about $12 million at 2009 prices according to the German Consumer Price Index. *  Officially acknowledged figure. Record-holders Throughout the silent era, the cost of film-making grew steadily as films became longer and more ambitious and the techniques and equipment became more sophisticated. It is not known for certain which was the first film to cost $1 million or more to produce, and several myths have grown over time: D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916) was reputed to have cost $2 million but accounts show it cost $385,906.77, and A Daughter of the Gods (1916) was advertised as costing a million dollars but Variety estimated its true cost at $850,000. The first film that is confirmed to have had a $1 million budget is Foolish Wives (1922), with the studio taking advantage of its exorbitant price and advertising it as ""The First Real Million Dollar Picture"". The most expensive film of the silent era was Ben-Hur (1925), costing about $4 million—an astronomical sum in those days at twenty-five times the $160,000 average cost of an MGM feature. It is unclear which sound era production superseded it as the most expensive film, although this is commonly attributed to Hell's Angels (1930), directed by Howard Hughes; the accounts for Hell's Angels show it cost $2.8 million but Hughes publicised it as costing $4 million, selling it to the media as the most expensive film ever made up. The first film to seriously challenge the record was Gone with the Wind (1939), reported to have cost about $3.9–4.25 million, although sources from the time state that Ben-Hur and—erroneously—Hell's Angels cost more. Ben-Hur was definitively displaced at the top of the chart by Duel in the Sun in 1946, meaning Ben-Hur may have held the record for 21 years. The 1950s saw costs rapidly escalate as cinema competed with television for audiences, culminating with some hugely expensive epics in the 1960s that failed to recoup their costs.  A prominent example of this trend was Cleopatra (1963), which lost money on its initial release despite being the highest-grossing film of the year. Since the 1990s, film budgets have once again seen a dramatic increase as the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) has become commonplace in big-budget features. *  Officially acknowledged figure.

https://www.citymetric.com/transport/i-cycled-length-all-london-s-cycling-superhighways-here-s-what-i-learnt-2910,I cycled the length of all London's Cycling Superhighways. Here's what I learnt,"The blue lane. The blue lane is what you concentrate on as you ride the cycle superhighways: the one or sometimes two metre thick painted channel between the pavement and traffic, between safety and danger. Sometimes the blue lane is segregated from the road; more often, you're just part of the road, but with your own space clearly designated. Sadiq Khan has promised to spend £770m on cycling over the four years of his term - £17 per Londoner, a record amount for the city – part of which will go on two new cycle superhighways. Ahead of that, it's seemed reviewing the current cycling infrastructure in London. So I decided to cycle all of the superhighways, and take in just how much they've changed London. I love cycling in London: there is something thrilling in going so fast in a city, especially when there is traffic congestion all around. This is what the superhighways are supposed to do: allow the cyclist to speed by, separated from the main road traffic and all the danger that entails. There are seven current cycle superhighways, helpfully numbered CS1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The network stretches from Tottenham in the north to Colliers Wood in the south, and Stratford in the east to Lancaster Gate in the south. The missing CS4, heading from London Bridge towards Woolwich, is supposed to go into consultation this year; there are also plans for CS9 from Hounslow to Olympia, and a CS11 heading north west from the West End, through Regent's Park. (What was planned as CS10 may end up as a western extension of CS3.) The point of the new routes is to make cycling safer, faster, and more appealing in the capital. The jewel in the crown is CS3, especially the section from Tower Hill to Westminster, which snakes around the curve of the Thames and completely segregates the bike rider from the main flow of traffic. Cycling along it, one can really appreciate the majesty of the Victoria Embankment – something that was previously impossible as you focused on dodging buses and lorries. The best parts of the network are always those with separated cycle lane: CS3 along the Embankment and into Wapping, and the north-south superhighway CS6. What you soon learn though, riding the blue lanes, is that it is not always like this. For every safe, well built stretch of superhighway, there is a poorly managed part. On CS7, as it passes through Balham towards Tooting, there are cars constantly parked in the cycle lane, along with drivers who don't appreciate the sanctity of your metre-wide blue haven. On stretches like this, the superhighway might as well not exist. You find yourself needing to dodge buses anyway – what's the point, when all that is different is the colour of the tarmac and a name? While the scheme is a mayoral project, the infrastructure is actually put in place by each individual borough. That's what creates this fantastic mismatch as you hurtle through London, and CS7 is the perfect example: Southwark and Lambeth seem to care about the cyclist; Wandsworth, on the other hand, seems to think the cycle lane is an afterthought, something to be shoved onto the side of the road. CS1 is the newest route to be fully completed, running from Tottenham to the City. But it doesn't seem to be very 'super': it's more like a glorified Quietway (another form of London cycle route, linking up quieter back roads), only with blue branding. It's also a genuinely confusing route, requiring careful checking of signs and road markings. Superhighways are easy to follow when they are just a blue lane; a bit trickier when there are only occasionally reminders of their existence. The sight of someone stopping just to attempt to decode a blue sign isn't a particularly edifying one, especially when you've had to pull over to the side of a main road to do so. Cycling infrastructure in London still has a long way to go to make cycling safer: cars still turn without checking, or drive straight into the cycle lane. This is something that can be solved with segregated sections and separate traffic lights for cyclists, like there are on other parts of the network. Nonetheless, according to the London Cycling Campaign, 6 cyclists died on CS2 between 2011 and 2014; since then the route, formerly of the blue paint variety, has been largely separated from the traffic. CS2 highlights another problem: how to cope with pedestrians blindly wandering into the cycle lane after they are disgorged from buses at bus stops. Inevitably, all they want to do is swear at you, and explaining that they're standing in a cycle superhighway doesn't particularly help. The route also features signs that can take a long time to understand – “turn right in two stages only”, “go left in order to go right” – all very entertaining as you attempt to cycle quickly into the wind. The best superhighway has to be what used to be CS6, now more often termed the “North-South superhighway”, which at the moment runs from Elephant & Castle to the Holborn Viaduct. The route is clear, the cycle lane stands completely apart from the traffic, and the dedicated traffic lights work without a hitch. You even get a fantastic view of St Paul's as you cross Ludgate Circus. It is no wonder that Blackfriars Bridge resembles the peloton of the Tour de France on a weekday morning. Cycle Superhighways are in their infancy, and there is no doubt that those that exist leave a lot to be desired. Yet everyone should have a go at riding within the blue line and explore London. It made me go to Colliers Wood for the first time in my life: there's no reason why others can't do the same. Want more of this stuff? Follow CityMetric on Twitter or Facebook Is the balloon about to go up? Speculation is rife that the government is finally about to scrap the struggling Northern Rail franchise, after Boris Johnson told yesterday's Prime Ministers' Question Time: “We are developing contingency plans for a replacement for Northern Rail”. He also, while on the subject, said that the government was “looking at the whole way the franchising system operates”. In some ways there's no new information here – Johnson is just echoing what transport secretary Grant Shapps said last week. But the fact the PM himself is saying it, and so soon, is a sign the government is seriously planning to move on this. It might not be today, or this week, or next – but Northern Rail's current contract can't be long for this world. The only slight problem here is – this won't fix the northern rail network. A large chunk of the network's problem isn't bad management (though there's no doubt been plenty of that too), but shoddy infrastructure. And the power to fix that lies not with the beleaguered train operating company, but in the government's own hands. In 2014, then Chancellor George Osborne did what he did best, donning some high vis clothing, to announce the “Northern Hub”, a £600m programme of rail investment. Here's a map: When first discussed in 2009, this project had been known as the Manchester Hub, on the fairly reasonable grounds that much of the work involved was in central Manchester. But the coalition re-branded it – partly to bring it in line with the Northern Powerhouse policy, partly because fixing the bottleneck in Manchester would allow more trains to run right across the region's rail network, from Cheshire to Tyneside. One key element of this scheme - the Castlefield, or Ordsall, Curve, which allows trains to run between Piccadilly and Victoria stations - had already received funding in 2011, and was completed in late 2017, when I got to have a go on it. But properly fixing the bottleneck would also require two new through platforms at Piccadilly, and work at Oxford Road station so that it could take longer trains. Without this work, there's a limit on the number of trains that can run. And even though all this passed all the necessary public enquiries as long ago as 2015, the work hasn't happened. Let's hear from Jen Williams at the Manchester Evening News, writing on Tuesday, to bring the story up to date: A pan-northern meeting of council chiefs will hear tomorrow how the delayed expansion of both stations has been a 'key' cause of the chaos that has been crippling the north's network. They will also hear that the opening of the £85m Ordsall Chord link through Castlefield, an investment regularly celebrated by ministers, has actually made the overall situation worse - because it was not coupled with the rest of the investment originally proposed. The result of all this is: The beleaguered Northern rail franchise, let in 2016, was designed for an improved corridor that didn't materialise. In other words, whatever the failings of Northern Rail management in working with its staff, ensuring there are enough trains available and so on, it was always doomed to failure: it had been given a timetable that the network couldn't handle. A report going before Transport for the North says there are only three choices now facing government: pay for the infrastructure, cut train services or accept 'the very poor reliability' that comes from running current number of services through the existing bottleneck. So far, ministers don't seem keen to pursue any of these options. They haven't stumped up for the infrastructure, and for fairly obvious reasons they don't seem likely to tell passengers that they have to lump it. Instead, they've found a fourth option, which won't fix the network but will get them off the hook: talk up plans to scrap Northern Rail's contract, and thus force the train operator to carry the can. Treating private companies as scapegoats has a long history on the British rail network – there's an argument, indeed, that this was basically what rail privatisation was for. The question is what the government does next. If it finds the estimated £800m needed to complete the Northern Hub project it might be able to fix this mess. If not, though, northern rail passengers are likely in for more misery – no matter who runs the trains.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UK_cities_by_GVA,UK cities by GVA,"This is a list of cities and conurbations in the United Kingdom sorted by their Gross Value Added (GVA), a measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy.

https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/activision-offers-refunds-for-guitar-hero-live,Activision offers 'Guitar Hero Live' refunds after obliteration of song library,"Activision has launched a voluntary refund program for Guitar Hero Live, which saw its song library obliterated at the end of 2018. Guitar Hero Live, rolled out in 2015, was the comeback of the franchise after it was shelved due to the market's over-saturation of rhythm games. The system featured a redesigned guitar controller, more realism and immersion while playing, and the Guitar Hero TV streaming mode that offered a growing rotation of songs. Guitar Hero TV replaced the premium DLC model of past Guitar Hero games, which required players to purchase additional songs. With Guitar Hero TV, players gained free access to a rotating library of nearly 500 songs for free. Unfortunately, Activision ended support for Guitar Hero TV, which will cut down the system's song library to only the 42 songs available on the CD, in December. A lawsuit was filed against Activision, and while it was dismissed about two weeks ago, it appears that a refund program was created to appease frustrated players. Activision introduced the Guitar Hero Live refund program through its support website. To qualify, players will need to have purchased the system in the United State from December 1, 2017 to January 1, 2019. They will also need to submit a completed claim form by the May 1 deadline, and the purchase will need to be confirmed by Activision. The surest way for Activision to confirm the purchase is through the submission of the official receipt, which may be hard for players who bought the system about a year ago. Fortunately, Activision will also accept credit card statements as proof of purchase, with players advised to hide or remove all the information on the document aside from their name, purchase date, store, and charge associated with Guitar Hero Live. Players who do not have a receipt or credit card statement may still submit a completed claim form, and Activision will try to verify the eligibility for a refund.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions,Custom Android distributions,"This is an incomplete list of aftermarket distributions (custom firmware, custom ROM) of the Android operating system that have received independent coverage in notable Android-related sources.

https://www.digitaltrends.com/web/cryptocurrency-mining-porn-sites,Adult content domains are home to half the sites using cryptomining malware,"A new study reveals that cryptocurrency miners are turning to porn sites to exploit users' computing power when they're online. A Bejing-based company called 360NetLab has analyzed internet traffic patterns and concluded that sites offering adult content, while small in terms of web traffic, make up the vast majority of sites containing web mining code on their homepages. These cryptocurrency mining programs usually download without permission when you click on the site and run in the background, using the computing power of your CPU to create new cryptocurrency (usually Monero). This can significantly diminish the performance of your computer while you're online. According to 360NetLab, 628 websites out of Alexa's top 300,000 contained cryptomining code within their homepage (Alexa is a web traffic and analysis service that ranks websites by visitors, not to be confused with the ubiquitous voice assistant of the same name). While small in terms of actual traffic, the research found that a whopping 49 percent of the domains containing cryptomining software were sites offering adult content. We're not linking to any of these sites for obvious reasons, but in terms of traffic the most-visited sites were mejortorrent, firefoxchina, scamadviser, and thepiratebay.blue. The most prevalent coin-mining tool is coinhive, which is used by 57 percent of the sites. Others include jsecoin, webmine, and cryptoloot. More and more mining site providers want a piece of the action as well. The coin-mining software downloads started to become more prevalent around September of last year, and saw a big surge in January. As the International Business Times points out, what these companies are doing is not technically illegal in most countries. Some sites claim that cryptocoin mining is a way to fund their websites, just like hosting advertising or asking for subscriptions. Most users would argue that it should be opt-in only. In fact, one new site called authedmine only mines with the user's permission. 600 websites is a pretty small number, however, so there's no need to panic. Any decent antivirus software can protect your computer by detecting the mining software before it's downloaded. As always, make sure your operating system and security software are up to date.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Internet_companies,Largest Internet companies,"This is a list of Internet companies by revenue and market capitalization.

By team The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different nations. Brazil has won the most titles, five. The current champion is France, who won the title in 2018. By year Participating teams have to register squads for the World Cup, which consisted of 22 players until 1998 and of 23 players from 2002 onwards. Since 1978, winners' medals are given to all members of the winning squads. Prior to that, only players who were on the pitch during the final matches received medals. FIFA decided in 2007 to retroactively award winners' medals to all members of the winning squads between 1930 and 1974. By player A total of 445 players have been in the winning team in the World Cup. Brazil's Pelé is the only one to have won three times, while another 20 have won twice. No player has won two World Cups both as captain. Italy's Giuseppe Meazza (1938), Brazil's Bellini (1958), Mauro (1962) and Cafu (2002), and Argentina's Daniel Passarella (1978) lifted the trophy once as captain, but were not captain for the other tournament they won. Argentina's Diego Maradona (1986, 1990) and Brazil's Dunga (1994, 1998) captained their sides in two final matches, but only won on their first occasions, while West Germany's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (1982, 1986) lost both final matches as captain. Brazil's Pelé and Vavá are the only two players to score in two final matches for winning teams. West Germany's Paul Breitner (1974, 1982) and France's Zinedine Zidane (1998, 2006) also scored in two final matches, but only won on their first occasions. Cafu is the only player to play in three final matches, 1994 (as a substitute), 1998 and 2002. Luis Monti is the only player to play in two final matches for different national teams. He appeared in the 1930 final for Argentina, who lost, and the 1934 final for Italy, who won. Attilio Demaría was also in Argentina's 1930 squad and Italy's 1934 squad, but appeared in neither final. Brazil's Mário Zagallo, having won in 1958 and 1962 as player, went on to win in 1970 as the head coach, becoming the first to win both as player and coach. West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer is the second, winning as both captain (1974) and coach (1990). Didier Deschamps is the third. He led the France team to win in 1998 as captain, and in 2018 as coach. Germany's Miroslav Klose is the only player to have won four World Cup medals: 2002 (silver), 2006, 2010 (both bronze) and 2014 (gold). By coach 20 different coaches have won the World Cup, Italy's Vittorio Pozzo being the only one to win twice. Four other coaches finished as winners once and runners-up once: West Germany's Helmut Schön (winner in 1974, runner-up in 1966) and Franz Beckenbauer (winner in 1990, runner-up in 1986), Argentina's Carlos Bilardo (winner in 1986, runner-up in 1990), and Brazil's Mário Zagallo (winner in 1970, runner-up in 1998). Zagallo (twice), Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps also won the title as players. All winning head coaches have been natives of the country they coached.

Mayo Clinic is working with a Singapore development firm to add a seven-story hotel plus four clinical treatment floors on top of its Gonda Building in downtown Rochester. Once completed, the project will make the now 21-floor Gonda Building into Rochester's tallest skyscraper with the hotel on top. The proposed addition will add about 185 feet to the building to bring it to 490 feet tall with 32 stories. Broadway Plaza, at 342 feet, is the tallest for now. “This is a strategic collaboration between the Pontiac Land Group and Mayo Clinic. It really addresses two important patient needs,” said Mayo Clinic's Executive Dean of Practice Dr. C. Michel Harper Jr. “One need is additional clinical space. We just get busier and busier … And the other need we'll meet is hospitality, which is also a need expressed for a number of years by our patients visiting Rochester.” Early estimates are for construction to start in late 2019 or early 2020 with the goal of having the hotel and medical floors ready for use by the end of 2022. Luxury builder Mayo Clinic's collaborator in the project, the Pontiac Land Group, is a firm known for its luxury properties worth an estimated $5.5 billion. It's led by the Kwee family. The Singapore hotel that hosted President Donald Trump's summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June is another one of the properties owned by Pontiac Land Group. “Our relationship with Mayo Clinic started about 12 years ago, when members of the family were patients. They experienced Rochester throughout the seasons and came to understand the peculiarities of this market,” said Pontiac Land chief operating officer Philip Kwee. “We could not think of a better partner to explore this intersection between health care and hospitality.” This will be Pontiac Land Group's second project in the United States. It is also developing an 82-story residential condominium complex in New York City, adjacent to The Museum of Modern Art. Cost of the smallest one-bedroom units start at $3 million. Lisa Clarke, the executive director of the Destination Medical Center initiative's Economic Development Agency, said her group started talking to Pontiac Land Group about two years ago. She says that no public assistance, such as tax-increment financing, will be requested to support the project. Big boost Mayo Clinic officials say taking the unprecedented step of allowing a luxury developer to build a hotel on top of a medical complex means that it can build the needed medical floors much sooner than the clinic could have managed on its own. Harper estimated Mayo Clinic would not have been able to add the floors to the Gonda Building for a decade and “it would probably cost us four or five times as much.” While the clinic is seeing strong financial revenue as well as booming donations, collaborating with a private developer like this allows Mayo Clinic to closely control its finances as it continues to grow. “It's really critical that we maintain the strength of our balance sheet. Therefore that's the reason for debt financing as opposed as trying to finance these out of cash flow from operations,” said Mayo Clinic's Chief Administrative Officer and Vice President Jeff Bolton. Mayo Clinic expects to invest $190 million to build the four additional medical floors, much of which will serve as an expansion to the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and Outpatient Procedure Center. Those floors will generate more local jobs in the spirit of DMC, Bolton added. The new hotel will add to the city's current tally of about 5,300 rooms for visitors, though other hotels under construction will open before it is completed. Details about the hotel, like its brand and what its rates will be, have not yet been finalized. However, looking at Pontiac Land's other hotels that include Four Seasons, it is expected that the hotel will be luxury property. High-end hotel While some consultants have said that Rochester needed a high-end hotel, developers like Javon Bea and the Bloom International Realty have said that their research did not show that the city could support a new high-end luxury hotel. Bolton said this hotel project is about looking to the future. “A lot of developers are concerned with the risk of the market. In many ways, we have to make a market in Rochester that doesn't entirely exist today. We feel, given the growth of the Destination practice, that now is the time to do that,” he said. Is there any concern that other developers, like Rochester's Titan Development & Investments that is building a 264-room Hilton hotel downtown, might be see this project as Mayo Clinic giving a competitor a head start? “We have had discussions with them (other hotel developers). Mayo's objective is to grow the pie, not change some slices of the pie. Mayo's success will benefit all of the providers of these services in the community,” Bolton said. The new hotel will offer additional health-related services as well as close proximity to medical care. The latter is very important to visitors to the Med City, according the interim executive director of Rochester's convention bureau. “The number one concern for visitors calling is finding the hotel closest to where their appointments (at Mayo Clinic) are scheduled,” said Mary Gastner, of Experience Rochester. This project is described as just the start of an ongoing collaboration between Mayo Clinic and the Pontiac Land Group. Leaders of both organizations didn't say what any future projects might look like, though they confirmed there might be others in Rochester as well as in other US and international locations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_bridges,Longest bridges,"This is a list of the world's longest bridges more than three kilometres long sorted by their full length above land or water. ""Span"" refers to the longest spans without any ground support.  Note: There is no standard way to measure the total length of a bridge. Some bridges are measured from the beginning of the entrance ramp to the end of the exit ramp. Some are measured from shoreline to shoreline. Yet others use the length of the total construction involved in building the bridge. Since there is no standard, no ranking of a bridge should be assumed because of its position in the list. Additionally, numbers are merely estimates and measures in U.S. customary units (feet) may be imprecise due to conversion rounding.

They are each one of the of the world heritage sites designated by UNESCO in the UK – and its overseas territories. The illustrious list was added to this week when the Lake District was named one, on account of its blend of beauty, farming and the inspiration it had provided to artists and writers. But how many of the others on the list do you know about? Did you know that Poldark country, mining landscape of Cornwall and Devon, was named one on account of its contribution to the copper industry? And have you ever heard of Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and its 40,000 interlocking columns of black basalt sticking out of the sea? From Liverpool to Bath, Edinburgh to Orkney, there are now 31 UNESCO world heritage sites to explore – your Great British bucket list just got a bit longer.

https://www.thelocal.at/20140618/austria-remains-second-richest-eu-country,Austria remains second richest EU country,"Austria remains, according to recent statistics from Eurostat, the second richest country in the European Union. Austria's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was around one third higher than the EU average in 2013. The richest country in the EU is Luxembourg. The economic output per capita in Luxembourg is more than two and a half times as large as the average for the 28 EU countries. One of the reasons for this is that many people commute to work in the tiny country. In Austria, the GDP per capita was 129 percent of the EU average. Behind Austria is Sweden and the Netherlands (both 127 percent), Ireland (126 percent), Denmark (125 percent) and Germany (124 per cent). The EU's poorest country is Bulgaria, whose economic output per capita is only 47 percent. Eurostat also looked at the actual individual consumption (TIV) per capita - which puts Austria in third place behind Luxembourg and Germany. The individual consumption takes into account the goods and services consumed by each household. Luxembourg's TIV in 2013 was 138 percent, Germany's was 125 percent and Austria's 119 percent. Bulgaria remained the poorest EU country with 49 percent.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_by_population,Metropolitan areas by population,"One concept which measures the world's largest cities is that of the metropolitan area, which is based on the concept of a labor market area and is typically defined as an employment core (an area with a high density of available jobs) and the surrounding areas that have strong commuting ties to the core. There is currently no generally accepted, globally consistent definition of exactly what constitutes a metropolitan area, thus making comparisons between cities in different countries especially difficult. However, for consistency, the sources on this article include official figures from governments only. As an alternative to the metropolitan area, Eurostat introduced the concept of the Larger Urban Zone in 2004. Similarly, OECD defines Functional Urban Areas for cities in OECD countries. Both Larger Urban Zone and Functional Urban Area define a city as an urban core surrounded by a commuting zone, and so are similar to the general concept of the ""metropolitan area"".

http://www.newnownext.com/porn-star-august-ames-dead/12/2017,Female Porn Star Found Dead After Refusing To Perform With Man Who Had Done Gay Porn,"Adult film star August Ames, 23, was found dead this week in an apparent suicide from hanging, The Blast reports. Ames had faced severe online backlash after tweeting last weekend that she would not do a scene with a male performer who had previously done gay porn, fearing the scene would put her at a higher risk of contracting HIV. “Most girls don't shoot with guys who have shot gay porn, for safety,” Ames explained on Twitter, noting that HIV testing differs between straight and gay sex scenes. “That's just how it is with me. I'm not putting my body at risk, I don't know what they do in their private lives.” While some fans and performers rushed to her defense, many others accused Ames of being homophobic and demanded that she issue an apology. “How am I homophobic if I myself am attracted to women?” Ames tweeted. “Not wanting to have sex with gay men is not homophobic; they don't want to have sex with me either.” “Apologizing for taking extra steps to ensue that my body stays safe? Fuck you guys attacking me when none of my intentions were malicious,” she continued. “I fucking love the gay community!” whichever (lady) performer is replacing me tomorrow for @EroticaXNews , you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn, just to let cha know. BS is all I can say🤷🏽‍♀️ Do agents really not care about who they're representing? #ladirect I do my homework for my body🤓✏️🔍 — August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 3, 2017 NOT homophobic.

Not wanting to have sex with gay men is not homophobic; they don't want to have sex with me either👋 so byeeeee — August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 3, 2017 fuck y'all — August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 5, 2017 Although friends and loved ones believe the online harassment may have contributed to her death, Ames had been open about her struggles with mental health issues such as bipolar depression and dissociative identity disorder. “She was the kindest person I ever knew and she meant the world to me,” says her husband, adult filmmaker Kevin Moore. Since entering the adult film industry in 2013, Ames had starred in more than 270 films, earning a nomination for Best New Starlet at the 2015 AVN Awards. “I am so disappointed in some of the people in the adult industry,” porn icon Jenna Jameson says, specifically calling out females who had attacked Ames on social media. “Her blood is on their hands.”",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_mining_companies_by_revenue,Largest mining companies by revenue,This is a list of the largest mining companies  in terms of revenue (in US billion dollars) as ranked by Statista in 2015.,,0.234062,"[['No','Company','Revenue (billion US dollars)','Headquarters']['1','Glencore','209.2','Switzerland']['2','BHP Billiton','69.4','Australia']['3','Rio Tinto','45.1','']['4','China Shenhua Energy','40','China']['5','Vale','33.2','Brazil']]",No|Company|Revenue (billion US dollars)|Headquarters
https://investmentcentre.moneymanagement.com.au/news/846574/australian-fund-managers-assets-hit-us$1.3-trillion,Australian fund managers' assets hit US$1.3 trillion,"Total assets under management of Australian fund managers grew to $1.3 trillion in 2017, representing a rise of 18.5 per cent. Total assets under management (AUM) of Australian fund managers grew 18.5 per cent to $1.3 trillion in 2017, according to a survey by Willis Towers Watson. Total AUM of the world's largest 500 managers grew to US$93.8 trillion, representing a rise of 15.6 per cent on the previous year, the survey found. Concentration was also evident in some asset classes in Australia, particularly unlisted infrastructure where the majority of the assets are managed by only a handful number of infrastructure managers, the firm said. “New entrants in this asset class require time to build out their businesses. The market remains very competitive in Australia,” said Dania Zinurova, head of manager research for Willis Towers Watson in Australia. The global advisory also said that the concentration of assets managed by the 20 largest managers globally reached the highest level since inception in 2000, and now accounted for over 43 per cent of the top 500 managers' total AUM. The research showed North America-based managers represent the majority of assets (58.1 per cent), although their share fell slightly in 2017, the first fall since 2008. European managers represented 31.8 per cent of assets managed (the UK being 7.4 per cent), Japan 4.8 per cent and the rest of the world 5.2 per cent (including Australia representing 1.4 per cent). Assets in each region grew in 2017. While the majority of total assets (77.6 per cent) are still managed actively, the share of passive assets has grown from 19.5 per cent to 22.4 per cent in the last five years. In 2017 passive assets grew 25 per cent. “There is an increasing interest from investors in high conviction active strategies in Australia, specifically in equities, and we see boutique start-ups continue to emerge in this space. This is likely to be driven by investors looking for more value for money,” Zinurova said.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_William_Shakespeare_screen_adaptations,William Shakespeare screen adaptations,"The Guinness Book of Records lists 410 feature-length film and TV versions of William Shakespeare's plays, making Shakespeare the most filmed author ever in any language.

""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"" are tied for shortest. Business Insider has organized all of the MCU movies in a chart to compare their runtimes. ""Avengers: Endgame"" shattered box-office records with $350 million domestically and $1.2 billion worldwide over the weekend, despite a 3-hour runtime. ""Endgame"" is the culmination of over 10 years of world building, and a follow-up to last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" which ended on a massive cliffhanger — so fans weren't phased by the length of the movie, which is the longest in the MCU.

Methodology The life expectancy is shown separately for males and females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities are also included in this list. The figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including ongoing wars, obesity, and HIV infections. Worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 71 years (70 years for males and 72 years for females) over the period 2010–2015 according to United Nations World Population Prospects 2015 Revision, or 69 years (67 years for males and 71.1 years for females) for 2016 according to The World Factbook. According to the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) data, women on average live longer than men in all major regions and in all individual countries except for Mali and Eswatini (Swaziland). The countries with the lowest overall life expectancies per the WHO are Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Somalia, Eswatini, Angola, Chad, Mali, Burundi, Cameroon, and Mozambique. Of those countries, only Lesotho, Eswatini, and Mozambique in 2011 were suffering from an HIV prevalence rate of greater than 12 percent in the 15–49 age group. Comparing life expectancies from birth across countries can be problematic. There are differing definitions of live birth vs stillbirth even among more developed countries and less developed countries often have poor reporting.

https://www.farmanddairy.com/top-stories/how-to-identify-common-breeds-of-beef-cattle/424963.html,How to identify common breeds of beef cattle,"Over 70 breeds of cattle can be found in the United States today. However, only about 12 to 15 breeds have a major influence on the cattle industry. Last week, we reviewed the most common breeds of dairy cattle. This week we'll look at the most common breeds of beef cattle in the United States, considering the same factors — appearance, hardiness, fertility, history and production uses. Although a large portion of the beef industry relies on crossbreeding to enhance the genetics of purebreds, management and consistency in product quality vary. Therefore, we will focus on purebreds. Appearance Color: Black or red. Markings: None. Size: Medium. Cows weigh around 1,200 pounds; bulls weigh over 1,800 pounds. Horns: Naturally polled. Other characteristics Region: Nationwide. Living conditions: Hardy cattle that can survive harsh winters, during snowfall and storms. Red Angus are said to adapt to warmer climates better than the more dominant Black Angus. Calves: Bulls are sought after for breeding and cows calve easily because of their dominant polled gene. Additionally, Angus calves mature faster than other breeds. Purebred calves are usually too small to go to market when they are born, so crossbreeding with dairy cattle is common for veal production. Health and temperament: Angus cattle are relatively docile and hardy. Even with minimal days on feed they manage to produce Prime and Choice grade meats. History The first Angus cattle were brought to the United States in 1873 when George Grant imported them from Scotland to Kansas. Although the cattle were rejected at first, their value was eventually realized and 1,200 cattle were imported into the Midwest from 1878 to 1883. Uses Angus cattle are a staple of the American beef industry. It is the most common breed of beef cattle in the US, known for superior muscling and marbling qualities. To be labeled “Certified Angus Beef” by USDA Graders, cattle must meet 10 criteria: Modest or higher marbling Medium or fine marbling texture “A” maturity 10- to 16-square-inch ribeye area Less than 1,050-pound hot carcass weight Less than 1-inch fat thickness Superior muscling No hump on the neck exceeding 2 inches Practically free of capillary ruptures No dark cutting characteristics NOTE: Red and black varieties are considered separate breeds in the United States, but have similar characteristics, which is why they were combined. Appearance Color: White to creamy white. Markings: None. Size: Large. Cows weight 1,250 to 2,000 pounds and bulls weigh 2,000 to over 2,500 pounds. Horns: Naturally horned. Other characteristics Region: Widespread in the United States. Introduced to southern states from Mexico, first, and later to New England states from Canada. Living Conditions: Able to perform well under a variety of environmental conditions. Calves: Charolais cattle produce heavy calves. Bulls have developed a reputation for grading up and herd improvement. Cows have a relatively easy time calving. Health and temperament: Charolais are rugged, large muscled cattle. They are able to graze aggressively in warm weather and withstand cold weather. Although they are not the most docile breed, Charolais are gentle natured. History In 1934, Charolais cattle were brought to the United States from Mexico. Imports stopped in the mid-1940s due to an outbreak of Hoof and Mouth Disease. The quarantine between the United States, Canada and Mexico lasted until 1965 when Canada opened its doors again. New bloodlines were then introduced to the New England states. Uses Charolais cattle are raised for beef. They are known for their superior growth ability and heavily muscled loins and haunches. They produce increased carcass weights, better yield grades and more marbling. Appearance Color: Red. Markings: None. Size: Large. On average, cows weigh around 1,650 pounds and bulls weigh around 2,200 pounds. Horns: Originally horned, but now a majority are polled. Other characteristics Region: Widespread throughout the United States. Ranks fifth in number of animals among beef breed associations in the United States. Living conditions: Able to adapt to many different climate conditions. In addition to the US, they have been introduced in Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and South Africa. Calves: The breed has superior fertility, calving ease, mothering ability, and growth rate of the calves. Health and temperament: Gelbvieh are known for their quiet temperament, quick maturity, longevity, muscling and high rate of grain and feed efficiency. History In July of 1971, Gelbvieh were introduced to the United States by Carnation Genetics by importing semen from Germany. Uses While the breed was originally selected for meat, milk and work, today, it is used primarily for beef production. Gelbvieh produce high cutout yields. They are known as a lean breed and a source of high quality, tender young beef. Appearance Color: Red and white. Markings: Hereford cattle are easily recognized by their hides, marked with a white face, crest, dewlap and underline. Size: Medium. Cows weight around 1,200 pounds and bulls weigh up to 1,800 pounds. Horns: Herefords, typically, have short, which horns, but a polled strain has emerged in North America and the United Kingdom. Other characteristics Region: Worldwide. Living conditions: The hallmark of the breed is its ability to produce a high yield of beef from eating native grasses. The hardy breed flourishes in a wide range of climates on almost every continent, today. Calves: Herefords are known for their longevity. Many females produce calves beyond the age of 15 years. Health and temperament: While Hereford cattle are considered a hardy breed because of their adaptability to various environments and ability to graze easily, they are known for a few health issues. Some common health risks include eye cancer, vaginal prolapse, dwarfism and higher risk for sun damage due to the light pigmentation of their udders. History Hereford cattle originally came to the United States in 1817, when Henry Clay brought a bull and two females to Kentucky. However, the first breeding herd was established in 1840 by William H. Sotham and Erastus Corning in Albany, New York. Uses Herefords were developed to produce a high yield of beef, while maximizing efficiency of production. These characteristics have made Herefords one of the most popular breeds of cattle worldwide with more than 5 million spread across over 50 countries. Appearance Color: Light wheat to darker golden red. There are also black varieties. Markings: None. Size: Large. Males range in size from 2,200 to 2,500 pounds. Females weigh between 1,500 and 1,600 pounds. Horns: The Limousine is known for lighter horns, which curve forward. However, many are dehorned as calves. Additionally, polled varieties have been developed. Other characteristics Region: Widespread throughout the United States, and present in about 70 countries worldwide. Living conditions: Limousins adapt easily to different climates and environments. Calves: A major reason Limousins have become popular is because of their ease of calving. Health and temperament: Once known for poor temperament, Limousine cattle have improved disposition over the years. They are also known for being heavily muscled and lean. History The Limousine breed got a late start in the United States when compared to others. The first bulls imported permanently into the United States arrived in the fall of 1971. Uses Limousins are selected for their higher dressing percentages and yield, high feed conversion efficiency and their ability to produce lean, tender beef. Appearance Color: Red, white, roan. Markings: Red and white (at least 30 percent red or white and 70 percent the opposite), red with white marks (a red body with some white marks on the underline, sides and one or more legs or face), roan (an intermingling of red and white hair over the entire body), also found in solid reds and whites. Size: Medium. Bulls weigh about 2,200 pounds and cows weigh 1,700 pounds. Horns: Yes, but can also be polled. Other characteristics Region: Found throughout the United States. Living conditions: Hardy and adaptable to various environments. Calves: Shorthorns are known for increased calving ease and fertility. Health and temperament: Shorthorns are known for their longevity, feeding efficiency and durability. They are also known for their docile temperament. One major drawback, caused by a recessive gene is tibial hemimelia (TH), which causes severe deformities in newborn calves. History Although Shorthorns were introduced in the United States in 1783, they weren't separated into Milking Shorthorn and Beef Shorthorn breeds until the latter half of the 2th century. Uses Shorthorns produce high-quality beef with good marbling. Appearance Color: Traditionally, red and white. However, are commonly solid black and red colors in the United States today. Markings: Traditionally, a majority red with white markings on their face, crest, dewlap, underline, tails and sometimes spotted backs. Presently, solid colored. Size: Large. Cows range in size from 1,500 to 2,000 pounds and bulls weight around 2,900 pounds. Horns: They can be horned or polled. Other characteristics Region: The American Simmental Association registers about 80,000 cattle annually throughout the United States. Living conditions: Easily adaptable to different climates and production structures. Calves: Simmentals are known for calving ease and good mothering traits. They have short intervals between calving, high fertility rates and the ability to reproduce long-term. Health and temperament: Simmentals are heavily muscled, fine-lined, well conformed and docile. They are also known for high fertility, longevity, early maturity, good growth rates and efficient feeding. They are also easy to handle and make good grazers. History Simmental semen was introduced to the United States in 1967, followed by the first Simmental bull in 1971. Uses Simmentals all over the world produce high beef yields. The heavy muscling, length and overall size and weight of the animal are combined to produce high-quality carcasses of solid red meat with a minimum of waste fat. How to determine if cattle are bulls, steers, cows or heifers How to identify common breeds of dairy cattle",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cloud_types,Cloud types,"The list of cloud types groups the tropospheric types as high (cirrus, cirro-), middle (alto-), vertical (nimbostratus, cumulus, cumulonimbus), and low (stratocumulus, stratus) according to the altitude level or levels at which each cloud is normally found. Small cumulus are commonly grouped with the low clouds because they do not show significant vertical extent. Of the multi-level genus-types, those with the greatest convective activity are often grouped separately as towering vertical.  The genus types all have Latin names. The genera are also grouped into five physical forms.  These are, in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity: stratiform sheets; cirriform wisps and patches; stratocumuliform patches, rolls, and ripples; cumuliform heaps, and cumulonimbiform towers that often have complex structures. Most genera are divided into species with Latin names, some of which are common to more than one genus.  Most genera and species can be subdivided into varieties, also with Latin names, some of which are common to more than one genus or species. The essentials of the modern nomenclature system for tropospheric clouds were proposed by Luke Howard, a British manufacturing chemist and an amateur meteorologist with broad interests in science, in an 1802 presentation to the Askesian Society.  Very low stratiform clouds that touch the Earth's surface are given the common names, fog and mist, which are not included with the Latin nomenclature of clouds that form aloft in the troposphere. Above the troposphere, stratospheric and mesospheric clouds have their own classifications with common names for the major types and alpha-numeric nomenclature for the subtypes.  They are characterized by altitude as very high level (polar stratospheric] and extreme level polar mesospheric). Cloud identification and classification: Order of listed types In section two of this page (Classification of major types), height ranges are sorted in approximate descending order of altitude expressed in general terms. On the cross-classification table, forms and genus types (including some genus sub-types) are shown from left to right in approximate ascending order of instability. In sections three to five, terrestrial clouds are listed in descending order of the altitude range of each atmospheric layer in which clouds can form: mesospheric layer; stratospheric layer; tropospheric layer. Within the troposphere, the cloud levels are listed in descending order of altitude range. Non-vertical genus types (including some genus sub-types) are sorted into approximate descending order of altitude of the cloud bases. Vertical or multi-level genera and genus sub-types can be based in the low or middle levels and are therefore placed between the non-vertical low and mid-level genus types and sub-types.  These thick clouds are listed in approximate descending order of altitude of the cloud tops. The species associated with each genus type are listed in approximate ascending order of instability where applicable. The constituent varieties and associated supplementary features and mother clouds for each genus or species are arranged in approximate order of frequency of occurrence. A count of basic tropospheric variants that result from the division and subdivision of genus types into species and varieties is shown as a number in parentheses from V-1 (variant 1) through V-92 after each variety, after nimbostratus that has no sub-types, and after certain species that are not always dividable into varieties. In section six, the cloud types in the general lists and the mother clouds in the applicable classification table are sorted in alphabetical order except where noted.  The species table shows these types sorted from left to right in approximate ascending order of the convective instability of each species.  The table for supplementary features has them arranged in approximate descending order of frequency of occurrence. In section seven, extraterrestrial clouds can be found in the atmospheres of other planets in our solar system and beyond.  The planets with clouds are listed (not numbered) in order of their distance from the sun, and the clouds on each planet are in approximate descending order of altitude. Cloud identification and classification throughout the homosphere The table that follows is very broad in scope and draws from several methods of classification, both formal and informal, used in different levels of the homosphere by a number of authorities. Homospheric types are cross-classified as a whole by form and level to derive the ten tropospheric genera, the fog and mist that forms at surface level, and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species as defined by vertical size and structure. It should therefore be seen as an illustration of how the various cloud types are related to each other at all altitudes from surface-level to the ""edge of space"", rather than as a strict classification per se. Polar mesospheric cloud identification and classification Clouds that form in the mesosphere have a generally cirriform structure, but are not given Latin names based on that characteristic.  Polar mesospheric clouds are the highest in the atmosphere and are given the Latin name noctilucent which refers to their illumination during deep twilight. They are sub-classified alpha-numerically according to specific details of their cirriform physical structure. Extreme-level stratiform, stratocumuliform, and cirriform Noctilucent clouds are thin, mostly cirriform-looking clouds, based from about 80 to 85 kilometres (262,000–279,000 ft) and occasionally seen in deep twilight after sunset and before sunrise. Type 1  Veils, very tenuous stratiform; resembles cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus. Type 2  Bands. Long stratocumuliform streaks, often in parallel groups or interwoven at small angles. More widely spaced than cirrocumulus bands. Subtypes 2A  Streaks with diffuse, blurred edges. 2B  Streaks with sharply defined edges. Type 3 Billows. Clearly spaced, fibrous cirriform, roughly parallel short streaks. Subtypes 3A  Short, straight, narrow streaks. 3B  Wave-like structures with undulations. Type 4  Whirls. Partial (or, more rarely, complete) cirriform rings with dark centers. Subtypes 4A  Whirls possessing a small angular radius of curvature, sometimes resembling light ripples on a water surface. 4B  Simple curve of medium angular radius with one or more bands. 4C  Whirls with large-scale ring structures. Polar stratospheric cloud identification and classification Polar stratospheric clouds form at very high altitudes in polar regions of the stratosphere. Those that show mother-of-pearl colors are given the name nacreous. Very high-level stratiform Nitric acid and water polar stratospheric Sometimes known as type 1, a thin sheet-like cloud resembling cirrostratus or haze. Contains supercooled nitric acid and water droplets; sometimes also contains supercooled sulfuric acid in ternary solution. Very high-level cirriform and stratocumuliform Nacreous polar stratospheric cloud (mother of pearl) Sometimes known as type 2, a thin usually cirriform or lenticular (stratocumuliform) looking cloud based from about 18 to 30 kilometres (59,000–98,000 ft) and seen most often between sunset and sunrise.  Consists of ice crystals only. Cloud identification and classification in the troposphere Tropospheric clouds are divided into physical forms defined by structure, and levels defined by altitude range.  These divisions are cross-classified to produce ten basic genus-types. They have Latin names as authorized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that indicate physical structure, altitude or étage, and process of formation High-level cirriform, stratocumuliform, and stratiform High clouds form in the highest and coldest region of the troposphere from about 5 to 12 km (16,500 to 40,000 ft) in temperate latitudes. At this altitude water almost always freezes so high clouds are generally composed of ice crystals or supercooled water droplets. Genus cirrus Abbreviation: Ci Cirriform clouds tend to be wispy and are mostly transparent or translucent. Isolated cirrus do not bring rain; however, large amounts of cirrus can indicate an approaching storm system eventually followed by fair weather. There are several variations of clouds of the cirrus genus based on species and varieties: Species Cirrus fibratus (V-1) High clouds having the traditional ""mare's tail"" appearance. These clouds are long, fibrous, and curved, with no tufts or curls at the ends. Cirrus uncinus (V-2) Filaments with up-turned hooks or curls. Cirrus spissatus (V-3) Dense and opaque or mostly opaque patches. Cirrus castellanus (V-4) A series of dense lumps, or ""towers"", connected by a thinner base. Cirrus floccus (V-5) Elements which take on a rounded appearance on the top, with the lower part appearing ragged. Opacity-based varieties None; always translucent except species spissatus which is inherently opaque. Fibratus pattern-based varieties Cirrus fibratus intortus (V-6) Irregularly curved or tangled filaments. Cirrus fibratus vertebratus (V-7) Elements arranged in the manner of a vertebrate or fish skeleton. Pattern-based variety radiatus Large horizontal bands that appear to converge at the horizon; normally associated with fibratus and uncinus species. Cirrus fibratus radiatus (V-8) Cirrus uncinus radiatus (V-9) Pattern-based variety duplicatus Sheets at different layers of the upper troposphere, which may be connected at one or more points; normally associated with fibratus and uncinus species. Cirrus fibratus duplicatus (V-10) Cirrus uncinus duplicatus (V-11) Varieties are not commonly associated with Ci species spissatus, castellanus, or floccus. Precipitation-based supplementary features Not associated with cirrus. Cloud-based supplementary feature Mamma Bubble-like downward protuberances; mostly seen with species castellanus. Genitus mother clouds Cirrus cirrocumulogenitus Cirrus altocumulogenitus Cirrus cumulonimbogenitus Cirrus homogenitus; cirrus formed by spreading of aircraft contrails. Mutatus mother cloud Cirrus cirrostratomutatus Cirrus homomutatus; cirrus formed by the complete transformation of cirrus homogenitus. Genus cirrocumulus Abbreviation: Cc. High-level stratocumuliform clouds of the genus cirrocumulus form when moist air at high tropospheric altitude reaches saturation, creating ice crystals or supercooled water droplets. Limited convective instability at the cloud level gives the cloud a rolled or rippled appearance. Despite the lack of a strato- prefix, layered cirrocumulus is physically a high stratocumuliform genus. High stratocumuliform species Cirrocumulus stratiformis (V-12) Sheets or relatively flat patches of cirrocumulus. Cirrocumulus lenticularis (V-13) Lenticular, or lens-shaped high cloud. Cirrocumulus castellanus (V-14) Cirrocumulus layer with ""towers"", or turrets joined at the bases. Cirrocumulus floccus (V-15) Very small white heaps with ragged bases and rounded tops. Opacity-based varieties None (always translucent) Stratocumuliform pattern-based variety undulatus Cirrocumulus with an undulating base; normally associated with stratiformis and lenticularis species. (V-16) Cirrocumulus stratiformis undulatus (V-17) Cirrocumulus lenticularis undulatus  (V-18) Pattern-based variety lacunosus Cirrocumulus with large clear holes; normally associated with stratiformis and castellanus species (also with cumuliform floccus species). Stratocumuliform lacunosus Cirrocumulus stratiformis lacunosus (V-19) Cirrocumulus castellanus lacunosus (V-20) Cirrocumulus floccus lacunosus  (V-21) Precipitation-based supplementary feature Virga Light precipitation that evaporates well above ground level; mostly seen with species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus. Cloud-based supplementary feature Mamma Bubble-like downward protuberances; mostly seen with species castellanus. Genitus mother clouds No genitus types. Mutatus mother clouds Cirrocumulus cirromutatus Cirrocumulus cirrostratomutatus Cirrocumulus altocumulomutatus Cirrocumulus homomutatus; results from the transformation of cirrus homogenitus. Genus cirrostratus Abbreviation: Cs Clouds of the genus cirrostratus consist of mostly continuous, wide sheets of cloud that covers a large area of the sky. It is formed when convectively stable moist air cools to saturation at high altitude, forming ice crystals. Frontal cirrostratus is a precursor to rain or snow if it thickens into mid-level altostratus and eventually nimbostratus as the weather front moves closer to the observer. Species Cirrostratus fibratus (V-22) Cirrostratus sheet with a fibrous appearance, but not as detached as cirrus. Cirrostratus nebulosus (V-23) Featureless, uniform sheet. Opacity-based varieties None (always translucent) Fibratus pattern-based varieties Cirrostratus fibratus duplicatus (V-24) Separate or semi-merged sheets with one layer slightly above the other. Cirrostratus fibratus undulatus (V-25) Undulating waves. Varieties are not commonly associated with Cs species nebulosus. Supplementary features/accessory clouds Not associated with cirrostratus. Genitus mother clouds Cirrostratus cirrocumulogenitus Cirrostratus cumulonimbogenitus Mutatus mother clouds Cirrostratus cirromutatus Cirrostratus cirrocumulomutatus Cirrostratus altostratomutatus. Cirrostratus homomutatus; results from the transformation of cirrus homogenitus..

Mr. Osinbajo, who was speaking at the opening of the 23rd Nigerian Economic Summit in Abuja, said the government was determined to realise its target of 10,000 MW generation capacity set in Nigeria's power generation capacity above 7,000 MW, said Mr. Osinbajo. “Government is dealing with the constraints of power distribution to ensure generated power get to the consumers. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC is working on an arrangement to ensure independent power distribution companies to sell power directly to metered customers. “This will not only help realize the 10,000 MW generation capacity envisaged in the ERGP, but also build to deliver that capacity to customers,” he said. Resolving the challenges in power generation, he said, was part of the government's efforts to develop the infrastructure necessary to sustain the growth of the economy following the exit from recession in the second quarter of this year. The Vice President highlighted some of government's achievements since last years' Economic Summit to include the resolution of the foreign exchange crisis and the restoration of stability in supply to investors and small businesses. “The issue of scarcity of foreign exchange last year has not only been turned around, but has stabilized, with foreign reserves rising to over $32 billion, with end users having increased access to foreign exchange to do their businesses,” he said. “The inflows into the economy from remittance by Nigerians have increased to about $1.8 billion, almost doubling the figure realized from the first quarter of this year, with the Anchor Borrowers Programme benefitting over 200,000 small-scale farmers, with over N43 billion of new investments from local investors. “We are moving steadily towards self-sufficiency in rice production, sorghum and many other products that are vital to the country's food security aspirations and exports. The N-power programme for unemployed graduates has employed already 200,000 graduates and another 300,000 are set to be recruited for this current phase.” Mr. Osinbajo also said the country had recovered a significant amount of crude oil production lost last year as a result of the crisis in the Niger Delta region. From daily loss of over one million barrels of oil last year, the Vice President said the series of engagements initiated by government led to the restoration of oil production to over two million barrels per day. He said the government will sustain the process of diversifying the economy, with the agricultural sector creating jobs, providing raw materials for manufacturing companies and helping earn foreign exchange for the economy. The chairman of the board of directors of the Summit, Kyari Bukar, said this year's Summit was building on the gains of last year's NES#22 theme of “Made in Nigeria”, which focused on the need to revitalize the economy through strategies that promote inclusive growth as well as higher levels of broad-based production and consumption. He said the NESG would continue to remain a viable ally of government in the development of the economy, saying its 10-policy Commissions have continued to work with the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies to actualize the NERGP, expand economic opportunities, improve productivity and create jobs for Nigerians. The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Udoma Udoma, said the NESG had continued to provide a useful platform for the public sector to engage with the private sector, development partners, academia, and Civil Society Organizations, on ways of working together to achieve faster economic development, and generally to improve working relationships. He said government cannot to allow the implementation of the ERGP to fail, adding that the summit was a forum to strengthen its partnership with private sector towards its success. “We are ensuring that our annual budgets are aligned with the ERGP so that government spending is driven by the Plan,” he said. “In addition, we have set up a special implementation unit to ensure effective delivery of the Plan and have also engaged staff to drive the process. “The focus of this year's summit is therefore implementation and that is why the theme: “Opportunities, Productivity, and Employment: Actualizing the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan,” he said.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources,U.S. states by electricity production from renewable sources,"The information used to calculate values is from the Electric Power Monthly, February 2015 and 2014 published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-listeners-tuning-in-to-sph-radio-stations,More listeners tuning in to SPH radio stations,"Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) said its five radio stations reached their biggest audience in the first half of the year, as its two new additions - 96.3 FM and Money FM 89.3 - drew many thousands more listeners. Over 600,000 people tuned in digitally to at least one of the media giant's radio stations last month, via the SPH Radio app or the website. This represents a rise of more than 40 per cent from last December, a month before SPH launched Chinese station 96.3 FM and Money FM 89.3 to add to its three existing ones: Kiss92, UFM100.3 and One FM 91.3. SPH's radio stations also attracted the most engaged audiences, with Kiss92 and One FM 91.3 emerging tops in total time spent listening, according to the results of a separate radio survey released by Nielsen yesterday. Listeners tuned in to Kiss92 and One FM 91.3 for an average of five hours, 41 minutes and five hours, 40 minutes respectively, during the survey from March 19 to May 13, compared with the average of four hours, 21 minutes for English stations. 96.3 FM debuted in the Nielsen study as the Chinese station with the second-longest time spent listening. Audiences spent 11 hours, five minutes tuned in during the survey period, compared with the average of nine hours, 56 minutes for Chinese stations. The Chinese station with the longest time spent listening was Mediacorp's Capital 958. 96.3 FM and Money FM 89.3 surpassed expectations in their first five months of operations, said SPH. 96.3 FM, which was launched on Jan 8, reached well over 110,000 digital listeners last month. Money FM 89.3 reached over 50,000 digital listeners on its debut. Singapore's first and only business and personal finance radio station in English was launched on Jan 29. As for SPH's existing stations, even with the launch of 96.3 FM, Chinese station UFM100.3's digital listeners grew by 20 per cent between last December and last month to reach 230,000, making it SPH Radio's most popular station digitally. UFM100.3's U1000 Music Countdown in April had 270,000 listeners tuning in digitally, with nearly 4,000 fans gathering at the live countdown event at Chinatown Point. The digital listenership of Kiss92 remained stable in the same period, while One FM 91.3's digital audience grew 15 per cent. One FM 91.3 - best known for its morning show Glenn and The Flying Dutchman - also saw its share of listenership double in the first half of the year from last year, bucking the trend among English stations, according to the Nielsen survey. In the Nielsen survey, which tracks both traditional and digital listenership, Kiss92 emerged as the second-most listened-to English station and the fifth overall, attracting 579,000 listeners a week. The four stations with the largest listenership were Mediacorp's Chinese stations Love 972, Yes 933, Capital 958, which came in first, second and fourth respectively; and its English station Class 95, coming in third. Mr Sim Hong Huat, SPH Radio's general manager, said: ""We are delighted with the overall results across all five radio stations and I am glad to have been receiving positive feedback on the two new stations, Money FM 89.3 and 96.3 FM. This is the result of our fans and our partners who believe in the power of SPH Radio, without which our achievements will not be possible.

https://archpaper.com/2018/01/chicagos-tribune-tower-condos-supertall-skyscraper,Chicago's Tribune Tower is gutted for condos as a supertall is proposed next door,"While Chicago's iconic Tribune Towers is undergoing a conversion from office building to condo tower, a 1,388-foot-tall steel and glass tower could sprout up next door. Tribune Tower's owners, the Los Angeles-based CIM Group and Chicago-based Golub & Co, have revealed plans to build what could be Chicago's second tallest skyscraper. After being sold in 2016 for $240 million to private developers, the top floors of the 36-story, Gothic Revival-styled Tribune Tower have been undergoing demolition since last October. While the building's facade and main lobby were landmarked in 1989, no such protections exist for the interiors, and Solomon Cordwell Buenz (SCB) is overseeing the conversion of what was once offices for Tribune Media into 165 condo units. Old Tribune Tower doors. Because who wants original details in their historic building, anyway? pic.twitter.com/pAv7YHeDLS — Liam TA Ford (@ltaford) January 6, 2018 According to the Chicago Tribune, CIM Group and Golub have proposed developing a narrow surface parking lot to the northeast of Tribune Tower into a mixed-use skyscraper designed by Chicago-based Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture. As the Chicago Tribune notes, Adrian Smith is no stranger to building tall, having led the design team for the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and Trump Tower Chicago when he was with SOM. The new tower would eclipse Trump Tower Chicago as the second tallest in Chicago, as Trump Tower only tops out at 1,171 feet tall, and uses a spire to reach 1,388 feet. The current proposal would see the creation of 220 hotel rooms and 158 condo units, as well as 500 parking spaces spread across floors two through eight of the new tower. Alderman Brendan Reilly described the design as “thin and soaring” based on renderings he had seen. This thinness is likely a response to the protected Ogden Slip view corridor, which means that Tribune Tower must remain visible from Lake Shore Drive as part of its landmarked status. While preservationists have been questioning whether this new development, which would dwarf the 462-foot-tall Tribune Tower, is inappropriate for the site, the conversion of Tribune Tower itself has also drawn their ire. The building's limestone base contains embedded chunks of famous buildings from around the world, and Alderman Reilly has stated that these panels will be relocated to different areas of the tower. Tribune Tower was built in 1925 following a widely-publicized design contest that awarded the $50,000 prize to New York-based Howells & Hood. The tower's Indiana limestone façade, gothic details, and crown composed of flying buttresses has made it an integral part of the Chicago skyline in the century since its opening. The conversion to residential space and the opening of ground floor retail is expected to finish in 2020; any construction on the adjacent lot is on hold until the Tribune Tower project is complete. The plans presented above are still subject to change, as the developers still need to procure funding and a rezoning of the lot before they can proceed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_wooden_buildings,Tallest wooden buildings,"Several wooden skyscraper designs have been designed and built, with the tallest currently being the Sanctuary of Truth, a 105-meter high temple in Pattaya, Thailand. The previous record holder, the 67-meter high Pagoda of Fogong Temple, was built 900 years ago.  Wooden skyscrapers are estimated to be around a quarter of the weight of an equivalent reinforced-concrete structure as well as reducing the building carbon footprint by 60–75%. Buildings have been designed using cross-laminated timber (CLT) which gives a higher rigidity and strength to wooden structures. CLT panels are prefabricated and can therefore speed up building time. The tallest actual wooden non-building structure is Gliwice Radio Tower (118 metres), the tallest ever-built wooden non-building structure was the tower of Muhlacker radio transmitter ( 190 metres, destroyed in 1945).",Tallest unfinished/proposed wooden buildings,0.53771,"[['Skyscraper','Height (m)','Floors','City','Dates','Status']['W350 Project','350','70','Tokyo','2041','Planned']['Oakwood Tower','304.8','80','Barbican','','Planned: Research Phase']['River Beech Tower','228','80','Chicago','','Proposed']['The Dutch Mountains I','150','','Eindhoven','2022 - 2023','Planned']['Timber Towers','','40, 60','Philadelphia','','Planned: Demonstration / Research Phase']['Sidewalks Lab','','50','Toronto','','Planned']['Trätoppen','133','40','Stockholm','','Proposed']['The Dutch Mountains II','110','','Eindhoven','2022 - 2023','Planned']['The Spar','91.44','48','Portland','','Proposed: Research Phase']['HoHo Wien','84','24','Vienna','','Under Construction']['Baobab','','35','Paris','','Proposed']['CF Møller Wooden','','34 x 4','Stockholm','','Proposed']['Abebe Court Tower','','26','Lagos','','Proposal']['Urban Lung','','25','Cardiff','','Proposal']['Kulturhus','76','19','Skellefteå','2019','Developer appointed']['U of T Academic Tower','74.5','14','Toronto','2019','To be built']['HAUT','73','21','Amsterdam','2020','Proposed: In sales phase']['Ascent','72.5','21','Wisconsin','2019','Planned']['Michael Green','','20','Vancouver','','Proposal']['Tham & Videgård','','20','Frihamnen','','Proposed']['Terrace House','71','19','Vancouver','','Under Construction']['Tree Tower','62','18','Toronto','','Proposed']['Tour Hypérion','57','17','Bordeaux','Estimated 2020','Proposed']['5 King Tower','52','','Brisbane','','Proposed']['Vertical Village','50','17','Ile de France','','To be built']['WoodUp','50','18','Paris 13','2021','Planned']['Light House','','14','Joensuu','Estimated 2019','Under Construction']['The Arbour','52.5','12','Toronto','Estimated 2024','Planned']['Framework','24+','12','Portland','','Approved']['Horizons bois','','12','Rennes','','Proposed']['Sensation','38','8, 11','Strasbourg','2019','Under Construction']['Riverfront Square','','6,8,11','Newark','','Searching tenants']['SKAIO','34','10','Heilbronn','2019','Under Construction']['PuuCity (WoodCity)','','8','Helsinki','','Under Construction']['Dutch Mountain','','7','Veldhoven','2021','Cancelled']['80 Atlantic','28','5','Toronto','2019','Under Construction']]",Skyscraper|Height (m)|Floors|City|Dates|Status
https://consequenceofsound.net/2009/11/cos-top-of-the-decade-the-albums,The Top 100 Albums of the 2000s,"And we're here… 2010. It's hard to believe that ten years have passed us. It almost seems like just yesterday David Fincher unearthed Fight Club to confused audiences, that Tony Hawk was only a skateboarder (and not a video game mogul), and The New Radicals were still, um, new. The truth is, 1999 doesn't seem so far away — especially when you pop in Californication or try and remember the slasher genre, namely those beloved Scream movies. In fact, it's hard to believe we're in “the future.” Hell, whenever Back to the Future, Part II comes on TBS (Don't tell me you forgot about this!), 2015 still seems far away, even though it's at arm's length now. Then again, maybe it all comes down to perspective. After all, when you turn to the side and think about the eight years with President Bush, the rise and decline and (somewhat) rise again of Tom Green, and the last time you bought a CD, it all feels about right. But overall, it doesn't feel like 2010. Instead of flying cars and video games that require you not to use your hands, we're bogged down with age-old past times, like recessions, health insurance scares, and U2. Nothing seems futuristic, save for a trip to the Apple Store, and while we're embracing the future with every inch that technology shifts forward, it all just sort of boils down to everyday mundane life. That doesn't really apply to music, though. Not at all. Each year, bands both new and old throw out album after album, stuffed to the brim with sounds that take us to yesterday, today, and, most of the time, to tomorrow. It's here where we understand the true value of time and how far we've come. Artists and groups like Animal Collective, Daft Punk, and even Radiohead take us by the hand into regions that suit our wildest dreams, where things happen that will never occur in our lifetime. Then there are those that keep us grounded, that help us understand our inner emotions and thoughts today, bands like Wilco, The Arcade Fire, and The Strokes. It's like we're sonically expanding our own dimensions. Pretty deep, huh? C'mon, it's 2009! Everyone knows how vital music is nowadays, and even though we're guilty of its absolute accessibility (eg the advent and success of the mp3), the past ten years have brought us new ways to celebrate its sonic brilliance. We all own iPods (or Zunes, for the five of you). We all walk and work and play with them in our ears — after all, we live for this stuff. But it's more than that. We don't just live for this stuff, we live with this stuff. You know, everyone has recognized again and again that albums have become just a hub for — or a collection of — songs, but few have noted that songs have become dalliances of everyday life. That's why it's important to go back, to look at where these songs come from, and to recognize the true power of that “hub”, or “collection”, or album!

https://hub.jhu.edu/2013/09/13/voyager-interstellar-space,"NASA's Voyager 1, launched in 1977, has left our solar system, scientists confirm","NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft officially has become the first human-made object to leave the solar system and venture into interstellar space, scientists confirmed yesterday. The 36-year-old probe, which launched in 1977, is about 12 billion miles from our sun. New data indicate Voyager 1 has been traveling for about one year through the plasma, or ionized gas, present in the space between the stars and is in a transitional region immediately outside the solar bubble. A report on the new observations is published this week in the journal Science. The Voyager team includes scientists from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. ""It's like the first time a satellite [Sputnik] went beyond Earth's atmosphere to an altitude of some 600 miles,said APL's Tom Krimigis, principal investigator for Voyager's Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP) instrument. ""Voyager is now leaving the solar bubble at an altitude of 11.3 billion miles. It's another historic milestone."" Added Ed Stone, Voyager project scientist based at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena: ""Now that we have new, key data, we believe this is humankind's historic leap into interstellar space. The Voyager team needed time to analyze those observations and make sense of them. But we can now answer the question we've all been asking: 'Are we there yet?' Yes, we are."" Voyager 1 first detected the pressure of interstellar space on the heliosphere, the bubble of charged particles surrounding the sun that reaches far beyond the outer planes, in 2004. Scientists then ramped up their search for evidence of the spacecraft's interstellar arrival, knowing the data analysis and interpretation could take months or years. Until mid-2010, the intensity of particles originating from inside our solar system had been holding steady. But in 2011 the intensity of those energetic particles (measured by the LECP instrument) began declining, as though they were leaking into interstellar space, and the radial expansion velocity of the solar wind went to zero. Readings over the past year showed that solar particles had essentially all left and galactic particle intensities increased dramatically, said Matthew Hill, an LECP team member and space physicist at APL. ""I remember saying then that if we had to decide based only on our LECP observations, we would say we crossed the heliopause last summer."" But without a plasma sensor that could regularly measure the density, temperature, and speed of plasma, Voyager scientists looked to the magnetic field, which didn't change direction at all, seemingly indicating that the intrepid probe remained in the solar magnetic field. That changed when an unexpected gift from the sun allowed Voyager 1 to make measurements of its plasma environment. A coronal mass ejection—or a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields—that erupted from the sun in March 2012 provided scientists with the data they needed. When the material eventually arrived at Voyager 1's location 13 months later, in April 2013, the plasma around the spacecraft began to vibrate like a violin string. On April 9, Voyager 1's plasma wave instrument detected the movement. The particular oscillations meant the spacecraft was bathed in plasma more than 40 times denser than what it had encountered in the outer layer of the heliosphere. Density of this sort is to be expected in interstellar space. ""We literally jumped out of our seats when we saw these oscillations in our data—they showed us that the spacecraft was in an entirely new region, comparable to what was expected in interstellar space, and totally different than in the solar bubble,"" said Don Gurnett, leader of Voyager's plasma wave science team at the University of Iowa. ""Clearly we had passed through the heliopause, which is the long-hypothesized boundary between the solar plasma and the interstellar plasma."" The scant evidence of solar influence that remains in Voyager's path just adds to the appeal of this mysterious region. ""While our data has been consistent with a clear separation of solar and galactic plasmas, we are not in pristine interstellar space as long as the cosmic rays are not equally distributed around the sky,"" Krimigis said. ""Perhaps we may arrive in the undisturbed galactic medium in the future, but we are not there yet. That's why Voyager observations are so exciting; we are in uncharted territory and we continue to be surprised every day.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_on_the_Moon,Artificial objects on the Moon,"This is a partial list of artificial materials left on the Moon.

Updated over several weeks in September of 2013, the list has an absolutely absurd number of excellent PC games—we've stopped doing official updates, but there are still new PC games coming in every now and then. Thanks so much to everyone who contributed. 2015 note: Sometime between when this article originally ran and now, Kinja decided to insert related links/images for every entry. On the one hand, it looks a little bit weird to see every game's title listed twice. On the other hand, I really like the image thumbnails. So, for now, I'll leave em in. And so!

The first title in the series, the eponymous Final Fantasy, premiered in Japan in 1987, and Final Fantasy games have been released almost every single year since. Fifteen games have been released as part of the main (numbered) series. Sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and related video games have been published, as well as numerous titles in other media forms. Each game in the main series takes place in a different fictional universe rather than serve as direct sequels to prior games, although some titles have received sequels, or prequels, set in the same universe. Most of the games have been re-released for several different platforms, many of which have been included in bundled releases. The series as a whole is primarily composed of role-playing video games, but also includes massively multiplayer online role-playing games, third-person shooters, tower defense games, and tactical role-playing games. Final Fantasy games have been released on over a dozen video game consoles beginning with the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as for personal computers and mobile phones. The series is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 100 million units worldwide as of June 2011, across both the main series and its spin-offs. Final Fantasy's popularity has placed it as one of the best-selling video game franchises. Main series Main series-related games Final Fantasy Tactics Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy Final Fantasy XV Universe Spin-offs Note that three games were marketed in North America as The Final Fantasy Legend series, but they were originally created as entries in the SaGa series of games, and are not true Final Fantasy titles. None of the three games bore any Final Fantasy branding in their original Japanese versions. The games of the SaGa series include no themes or characters from the Final Fantasy games, therefore they are excluded from this list. Bundled releases Branded subseries These are groups of games or system-specific releases of games that are branded or marketed together. Unlike bundles, they were made available as individual products.",,0.796191,"[['Title','Details']['Final Fantasy; Original release dates:: JP: December 18, 1987; NA: July 12, 1990; PAL: March 14, 2003; (PlayStation version);','Release years by system: 1987 – Nintendo Entertainment System; 1989 – MSX; 2000 – WonderSwan Color; 2002 – PlayStation; 2004 – Game Boy Advance; 2004 – Mobile phones; 2007 – PlayStation Portable (Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition); 2010 – iOS; 2012 – Windows Phone; 2012 – Android; 2014 – Nintendo 3DS']['Final Fantasy; Original release dates:: JP: December 18, 1987; NA: July 12, 1990; PAL: March 14, 2003; (PlayStation version);','Notes:: Included in the Final Fantasy I-II (Family Computer, 1994), Final Fantasy Origins (PlayStation, 2002), and Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls (Game Boy Advance, 2004) bundle and the Final Fantasy Mobile (Mobile phones, 2004) subseries; NES version available on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, North America & Europe/Australia.

https://time.com/3667986/harry-potter-oscars,See How the Oscars Are Honoring Harry Potter,"Plenty of Oscar winners and nominees starred in the Harry Potter franchise, and it was nominated for 12 Academy Awards over the span of its eight-film series. But it won none, leading some to call it the “most-snubbed-top-grossing franchise of all time.” But The Academy, or at least whoever runs Oscars.org, has launched a new section of its Collection Highlights dedicated to The Boy Who Lived. Fans will find 27 pieces of Potter content, including casting and directing rumors, photos from the set and more. There's newspaper clippings (but they don't move like the Wizarding World's Daily Prophet) highlighting some of the biggest media storms surrounding the films. For example, Steven Spielberg was long-rumored to spearhead the first film in the series and many speculated that an American actor could have been cast as Harry. And superfans might be surprised to learn that in June 2000, Tim Roth, well-known for Pulp Fiction, was originally cast as Severus Snape. The role eventually went to Alan Rickman after Roth chose to star in Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes The special section also recounts the drama over who would play Dumbledore after Richard Harris, the original Hogwarts Headmaster, died in 2003. Radcliffe spoke out about the Academy's snubs in 2012, when Hugo and The Artist dominated the awards, saying: “I don't think the Oscars like commercial films, or kids' films, unless they're directed by Martin Scorsese. I was watching Hugo the other day and going, 'Why is this nominated and we're not?' I was slightly miffed. … There's a certain amount of snobbery. It's kind of disheartening. I never thought I'd care. But it would've been nice to have some recognition, just for the hours put in.”",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films,Walt Disney Pictures films,"This is a list of films produced by and released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner (known as that since 1983, with Never Cry Wolf as its first release) and films released before that under the former name of the parent company, Walt Disney Productions (1929–1983). Most films listed here were distributed theatrically in the United States by the company's distribution division, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (formerly known as Buena Vista Distribution Company [1953–1987] and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution [1987–2007]).

Some films produced by Walt Disney Pictures are also set to be released under the parent company's streaming service, Disney+.

https://www.flavorwire.com/251055/the-10-most-expensive-books-in-the-world,The 10 Most Expensive Books in the World,"It could be a record-breaking afternoon in the book world. Today, Christie's New York will auction off a copy of John James Audubon's Birds of America, which already holds the title of most valuable printed book in the world, having sold for about $11.5 million in 2010. In fact, according to The Economist , a true list of the ten most valuable single books ever sold would have to include five copies of The Birds of America. Though Christie's is playing their cards close to the vest and estimating a $7 to $10 million sale, today could see a new record for the book. After all, the copy that sold for $11.5 million was estimated at less than the copy on auction today. To help you brush up on your knowledge of the very old and very valuable, we've compiled a list of the ten most expensive books ever sold — no white gloves necessary. Click through for an overview, and then head upstairs to check your attics for any forgotten dusty tomes — you could be a millionaire and not even know it. The First Book of Urizen, William Blake — $2.5 million Originally printed in 1794, The First Book of Urizen is one of the major pieces (and some say the most important) in Blake's series of prophetic works. One of only eight known surviving copies was sold at Sotheby's New York in 1999 for $2.5 million to a private collector. The Tales of Beedle the Bard, JK Rowling — $3.98 million Before this book, meant to be the same children's book that figures heavily in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, became a mass-market paperback, JK Rowling created seven original copies, each one handwritten and illustrated by Rowling herself. Six were given to friends and editors, but in 2007, one of the seven was put up for auction. It was snapped up by Amazon.com for a whopping $3.98 million, making it the most expensive modern manuscript ever purchased at auction. The money from the sale of the book was donated to The Children's Voice charity campaign. Geographia Cosmographia, Claudius Ptolemy — $4 million The world's first printed atlas, and the world's first book to make use of engraved illustrations, Ptolemy's 1477 Cosmographia sold at Sotheby's London in 2006 for £2,136,000, or almost $4 million at the time. Traité des arbres fruitiers [Treatise on Fruit Trees] by Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau, illustrated by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and Pierre Jean François Turpin — $4.5 million Definitely the most expensive book ever written about fruit trees (featuring sixteen different varieties!), a copy of this lush, five volume set of illustrations and text sold for about $4.5 million in 2006. The Gutenberg Bible — $4.9 million A copy of the Gutenberg Bible sold in 1987 for a then-record $4.9 million at Christie's New York. Only 48 of the books — the first to be printed with movable type — exist in the world. First Folio, William Shakespeare — $6 million Though the First Folio's original price was a single pound (one or two more if you wanted it bound in leather or otherwise adorned), intact copies are now among the most highly prized finds among book collectors, with only an estimated 228 (out of an original 750) left in existence. In 2001, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen purchased a copy for $6,166,000 at Christie's New York. The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer — $7.5 million A first edition of the 15th century bawd-fest sold for £4.6m (or about $7.5 million at the time) at Christie's in London in 1998. Of the dozen known copies of the 1477 first edition, this was the last to be held privately, and was originally purchased for £6 by the first Earl Fitzwilliam at the sale of John Radcliffe's library at Christie's in 1776. Talk about growing your investment. Birds of America, James Audubon — $11.5 million In 2000, Christie's auctioned off a copy (one of only 119 known complete copies in the world) of Birds in America for $8,802,500. Ten years later, another complete first edition was sold at London at Sotheby's for £7,321,250 (or about $11.5 million) Today, another copy of the enormous four volume set goes up for auction at Christie's, and perhaps another world record will be made. The Gospels of Henry the Lion, Order of Saint Benedict — $11.7 million Originally commissioned by Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, for the altar of the Virgin Mary at the Brunswick Cathedral, this gospel book was purchased by the German government at Sotheby's of London in 1983 for £8,140,000, or about $11.7 million (at the time). At 266 pages, including 50 full-page illustrations, the book is considered a masterpiece of the 12th century Romanesque illuminated manuscript. The Codex Leicester, Leonardo da Vinci — $30.8 million The most famous of da Vinci's scientific journals, the 72-page notebook is filled with the great thinker's handwritten musings and theories on everything from fossils to the movement of water to what makes the moon glow. The manuscript was first purchased in 1717 by Thomas Coke, who later became the Earl of Leicester, and then, in 1980, bought from the Leicester estate by art collector Armand Hammer (whose name the manuscript bore for the fourteen years he owned it). In 1994, Bill Gates nabbed the journal at auction for $30,800,000, making it the most expensive book ever purchased. But hey, at least Gates put his purchase to good use — he had the book scanned and turned into a screensaver distributed with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures,Countries by military expenditures,"This article contains a list of countries by military expenditure in a given year.

https://www.genengnews.com/a-lists/top-25-biotech-companies-of-2019,Top 25 Biotech Companies of 2019,"“The Biggest Biotech Bombshell in Years,” declared The Motley Fool of Biogen's market-moving announcement October 22 that it was planning to file for FDA approval of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate aducanumab, being co-developed with Eisai, despite halting two failed Phase III studies of the drug in March. Investors flocked to Biogen stock, sending the company's stock price surging 40% before the start of trading that day. When the market closed, Biogen shares finished the day 26% higher at $281.87. “This news, in our view, means the FOMO [fear of missing out] component is firmly back to occupy investor mind share as the multi-billion AD market is simply too large to ignore,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Sumant Kulkarni and associate Jia Min, CFA, wrote in an October 23 note to investors. That FOMO appears to explain why Biogen wasn't the only biotech company whose shares jumped on the news. Stocks for most biotechs rose in the days that followed the aducanumab announcement, judging from activity among the three top electronic transfer funds (ETFs). In the seven trading days since Biogen sent shares soaring, the largest ETF—the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB)—rose 3.9%, going from $103.58 on October 21 to $107.59 on October 30. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) rose 2.1%, from $80.09 to $81.80; Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF (PJP) rose 3.7%, from $57.65 to $59.81; while the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT) increased 2.9, from $127.40 to $131.07. The Biogen surge enabled IBB to record an increase from its price on October 30, 2018, as the fund rose 3.8% from $103.63. Also rising year-over-year was XBI, up 4.4% from $78.36. However, year-over-year, pharma-heavy PJP is down 9.9% from $66.35, while the limited 30-stock FBT is down just 1.2% from $132.69. Absent any market meltdown in coming week, 2019 is seeing the first year-over-year aggregate increase since 2015 in the total market capitalization of the 25 biotechs with the highest market capitalization or “market cap” as of October 30—to $963.495 billion, up 4.9% from $918.85 billion reported by GEN's “Top 25 Biotech Companies of 2018.” This overall increase comes despite an even split among gainers and losers, with 12 companies reporting growing market caps, another 12 companies shrinking (one company was not public last year so a comparison was not applicable). The total market cap of GEN's top 25 companies has shrunk from an all-time high of $1.225 trillion in GEN's Top 25 Biotech Companies of 2015—to $1.047 trillion reported by GEN's Top 25 of 2016 and $1.007 trillion tallied by the top 25 companies the following year. Below is GEN's updated list of 25 biotech companies, ranked by their market cap as of October 30, 2019, as furnished by the exchanges on which they trade their shares, or by other publicly available sources. Figures are rounded off to the nearest 10 except for two companies (Nos. 20 and 21) which were hundredths of a point apart. The smallest company listed this year has a market cap of just over $10 billion, compared with $9.4 billion for last year's 25th ranked company, which fell out of this year's Top 25. Companies based outside the US accounted for more than half (14) of the companies ranked on this year's Top 25 list, one more than on GEN's 2018 A-List. The largest portion of overseas companies are the five biotechs based in China (including Hong Kong), followed by two companies based in South Korea; two based in Belgium; another two in Denmark; and one each based in Australia, India, and Ireland. One company on this list is headquartered in the US, but domiciled for tax purposes in the UK Only 10 of the Top 25 biotechs (including just six of the top 10) are both domiciled in the US and maintain key operations stateside. Just missing the list at No. 26 is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which had a market cap of just over $9.7 billion on October 30, followed by Neurocrine ($8.947 billion) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which last year ranked No. 15 with a $20.4 billion (NIS 75.9 billion) market cap. Teva's market cap has fallen by more than half (57.8%) since then, to $8.635 billion (INS 30.443 billion). 25. Mylan $10.0 billion Nasdaq (MYL) Down 37.1% 24.

The review aggregator website's top 100 is a rotating list of the top films with more than 40 critic reviews, ranked by their ""adjusted score"", where each critic from their list gets one vote each. It makes for a list that differs greatly from other similar lists - like that of IMDb's - and throws up some interesting questions for film fans. Is Wonder Woman really better than 12 Angry Men, Seven Samurai and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly? Is Dunkirk really the best war movie ever made? Is Thor: Ragnarok really better than Apocalypse Now? Are the two best Star Wars movies ever made really The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens? Is Paddington 2 really better than The 400 Blows?

https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/6/17434666/guitar-hero-live-shutdown-song-library-activision,"Guitar Hero Live's Guitar Hero TV to shut down, dramatically reducing the song catalog","Guitar Hero Live's streaming music service, Guitar Hero TV, will close down in December, effectively cutting the game's accessible library to just 42 songs. When it launched in October 2015, Guitar Hero TV eschewed paid downloadable content to expand the game's song library, where songs were made free in a rotation, although some were also accessible through microtransactions. The trade-off is that the song catalog, which Ars Technica notes stands at 484, would only be available as long as Activision supported it. Apparently, the end of their licensing agreements comes in December, so out goes it all. The Rock Band series, by contrast, has more than 2,000 downloadable content songs spanning a franchise dating to 2007. (Rock Band 4, which launched October 2015, is the latest game.) While they cost money, they can be kept and played even if they're removed from the online offerings. For Guitar Hero Live, once Guitar Hero TV closes players will have just the 42 songs that were available on the disc when it launched. Activision's notice to Guitar Hero Live players mentions that the unlocked Premium Shows content and the iOS version of the game — which has already been pulled from the App Store — will also be nonfunctional as of Dec. 1. Hero Cash, the in-game currency, is still usable through Nov. 30, 2018, but it, too, is useless as of Dec. 1. Basically, the shutdown means players only have what is on the original console disc. Guitar Hero Live launched Oct. 20, 2015, on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Our review scored the game a 9 and praised Guitar Hero TV, saying “there's so much room for discovery just by channel surfing,” the service. Guitar Hero Live, along with Rock Band 4, briefly rekindled the music gaming genre on the current console generation, after going dormant for the five years following Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock's 2010 release.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Queen,Songs recorded by Queen,This is a list of all songs recorded by Queen.

https://www.si.com/olympics/2018/02/11/future-olympics-hosts-games-countries-cities-winter-summer,Future Olympics Hosts: Cities Set to Host the Games,"The 2018 PyeongChang Games are barely underway, but you're probably already wondering which countries and cities will host future Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has already selected several Olympic hosts through 2028—though the host city for the 2026 Winter Games has yet to be named. Including this year, each of the next three Olympics will take place in Asia: 2018 in PyeongChang, South Korea; 2020 in Tokyo, Japan; and 2022 in Beijing, China. Paris will host the 2024 Summer Games, marking the 100th anniversary of the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Olympics, bringing the Games back to the United States for the first time since Salt Lake City hosted in 2002. The IOC wasn't expected to name the host city for the 2028 Games until 2021, but the organization instead named both the 2024 and 2028 hosts last year. The IOC will select the host city for the 2026 Winter Games next year.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_winners,FIFA World Cup winners,"This is a list of all teams, players and coaches who have won the FIFA World Cup tournament since its inception in 1930. By team The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different nations. Brazil has won the most titles, five. The current champion is France, who won the title in 2018. By year Participating teams have to register squads for the World Cup, which consisted of 22 players until 1998 and of 23 players from 2002 onwards. Since 1978, winners' medals are given to all members of the winning squads. Prior to that, only players who were on the pitch during the final matches received medals. FIFA decided in 2007 to retroactively award winners' medals to all members of the winning squads between 1930 and 1974. By player A total of 445 players have been in the winning team in the World Cup. Brazil's Pelé is the only one to have won three times, while another 20 have won twice. No player has won two World Cups both as captain. Italy's Giuseppe Meazza (1938), Brazil's Bellini (1958), Mauro (1962) and Cafu (2002), and Argentina's Daniel Passarella (1978) lifted the trophy once as captain, but were not captain for the other tournament they won. Argentina's Diego Maradona (1986, 1990) and Brazil's Dunga (1994, 1998) captained their sides in two final matches, but only won on their first occasions, while West Germany's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (1982, 1986) lost both final matches as captain. Brazil's Pelé and Vavá are the only two players to score in two final matches for winning teams. West Germany's Paul Breitner (1974, 1982) and France's Zinedine Zidane (1998, 2006) also scored in two final matches, but only won on their first occasions. Cafu is the only player to play in three final matches, 1994 (as a substitute), 1998 and 2002. Luis Monti is the only player to play in two final matches for different national teams. He appeared in the 1930 final for Argentina, who lost, and the 1934 final for Italy, who won. Attilio Demaría was also in Argentina's 1930 squad and Italy's 1934 squad, but appeared in neither final. Brazil's Mário Zagallo, having won in 1958 and 1962 as player, went on to win in 1970 as the head coach, becoming the first to win both as player and coach. West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer is the second, winning as both captain (1974) and coach (1990). Didier Deschamps is the third. He led the France team to win in 1998 as captain, and in 2018 as coach. Germany's Miroslav Klose is the only player to have won four World Cup medals: 2002 (silver), 2006, 2010 (both bronze) and 2014 (gold). By coach 20 different coaches have won the World Cup, Italy's Vittorio Pozzo being the only one to win twice. Four other coaches finished as winners once and runners-up once: West Germany's Helmut Schön (winner in 1974, runner-up in 1966) and Franz Beckenbauer (winner in 1990, runner-up in 1986), Argentina's Carlos Bilardo (winner in 1986, runner-up in 1990), and Brazil's Mário Zagallo (winner in 1970, runner-up in 1998). Zagallo (twice), Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps also won the title as players. All winning head coaches have been natives of the country they coached. Only two foreign coaches have reached the final match: George Raynor of England, with Sweden in 1958, and Ernst Happel of Austria, with the Netherlands in 1978.",Players who have won the World

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-salem-witch-trials-175162489,A Brief History of the Salem Witch Trials,"The Salem witch trials occurred in colonial Massachusetts between 1692 and 1693. More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft—the Devil's magic—and 20 were executed. Eventually, the colony admitted the trials were a mistake and compensated the families of those convicted. Since then, the story of the trials has become synonymous with paranoia and injustice, and it continues to beguile the popular imagination more than 300 years later. Salem Struggling Several centuries ago, many practicing Christians, and those of other religions, had a strong belief that the Devil could give certain people known as witches the power to harm others in return for their loyalty. A ""witchcraft craze"" rippled through Europe from the 1300s to the end of the 1600s. Tens of thousands of supposed witches—mostly women—were executed. Though the Salem trials came on just as the European craze was winding down, local circumstances explain their onset. In 1689, English rulers William and Mary started a war with France in the American colonies. Known as King William's War to colonists, it ravaged regions of upstate New York, Nova Scotia and Quebec, sending refugees into the county of Essex and, specifically, Salem Village in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. (Salem Village is present-day Danvers, Massachusetts; colonial Salem Town became what's now Salem.) The displaced people created a strain on Salem's resources. This aggravated the existing rivalry between families with ties to the wealth of the port of Salem and those who still depended on agriculture. Controversy also brewed over Reverend Samuel Parris, who became Salem Village's first ordained minister in 1689, and was disliked because of his rigid ways and greedy nature. The Puritan villagers believed all the quarreling was the work of the Devil. In January of 1692, Reverend Parris' daughter Elizabeth, age 9, and niece Abigail Williams, age 11, started having ""fits."" They screamed, threw things, uttered peculiar sounds and contorted themselves into strange positions, and a local doctor blamed the supernatural. Another girl, Ann Putnam, age 11, experienced similar episodes. On February 29, under pressure from magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne, the girls blamed three women for afflicting them: Tituba, the Parris' Caribbean slave; Sarah Good, a homeless beggar; and Sarah Osborne, an elderly impoverished woman. Witch Hunt All three women were brought before the local magistrates and interrogated for several days, starting on March 1, 1692. Osborne claimed innocence, as did Good. But Tituba confessed, ""The Devil came to me and bid me serve him."" She described elaborate images of black dogs, red cats, yellow birds and a ""black man"" who wanted her to sign his book. She admitted that she signed the book and said there were several other witches looking to destroy the Puritans. All three women were put in jail. With the seed of paranoia planted, a stream of accusations followed for the next few months. Charges against Martha Corey, a loyal member of the Church in Salem Village, greatly concerned the community; if she could be a witch, then anyone could. Magistrates even questioned Sarah Good's 4-year-old daughter, Dorothy, and her timid answers were construed as a confession. The questioning got more serious in April when Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth and his assistants attended the hearings. Dozens of people from Salem and other Massachusetts villages were brought in for questioning. On May 27, 1692, Governor William Phipps ordered the establishment of a Special Court of Oyer (to hear) and Terminer (to decide) for Suffolk, Essex and Middlesex counties. The first case brought to the special court was Bridget Bishop, an older woman known for her gossipy habits and promiscuity. When asked if she committed witchcraft, Bishop responded, ""I am as innocent as the child unborn."" The defense must not have been convincing, because she was found guilty and, on June 10, became the first person hanged on what was later called Gallows Hill. Five days later, respected minister Cotton Mather wrote a letter imploring the court not to allow spectral evidence—testimony about dreams and visions. The court largely ignored this request and five people were sentenced and hanged in July, five more in August and eight in September. On October 3, following in his son's footsteps, Increase Mather, then president of Harvard, denounced the use of spectral evidence: ""It were better that ten suspected witches should escape than one innocent person be condemned."" Governor Phipps, in response to Mather's plea and his own wife being questioned for witchcraft, prohibited further arrests, released many accused witches and dissolved the Court of Oyer and Terminer on October 29. Phipps replaced it with a Superior Court of Judicature, which disallowed spectral evidence and only condemned 3 out of 56 defendants. Phipps eventually pardoned all who were in prison on witchcraft charges by May 1693. But the damage had been done: 19 were hanged on Gallows Hill, a 71-year-old man was pressed to death with heavy stones, several people died in jail and nearly 200 people, overall, had been accused of practicing ""the Devil's magic."" Restoring Good Names Following the trials and executions, many involved, like judge Samuel Sewall, publicly confessed error and guilt. On January 14, 1697, the General Court ordered a day of fasting and soul-searching for the tragedy of Salem. In 1702, the court declared the trials unlawful. And in 1711, the colony passed a bill restoring the rights and good names of those accused and granted £600 restitution to their heirs. However, it was not until 1957—more than 250 years later—that Massachusetts formally apologized for the events of 1692. In the 20th century, artists and scientists alike continued to be fascinated by the Salem witch trials. Playwright Arthur Miller resurrected the tale with his 1953 play The Crucible, using the trials as an allegory for the McCarthyism paranoia in the 1950s. Additionally, numerous hypotheses have been devised to explain the strange behavior that occurred in Salem in 1692. One of the most concrete studies, published in Science in 1976 by psychologist Linnda Caporael, blamed the abnormal habits of the accused on the fungus ergot, which can be found in rye, wheat and other cereal grasses. Toxicologists say that eating ergot-contaminated foods can lead to muscle spasms, vomiting, delusions and hallucinations. Also, the fungus thrives in warm and damp climates—not too unlike the swampy meadows in Salem Village, where rye was the staple grain during the spring and summer months. In August 1992, to mark the 300th anniversary of the trials, Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel dedicated the Witch Trials Memorial in Salem. Also in Salem, the Peabody Essex Museum houses the original court documents, and the town's most-visited attraction, the Salem Witch Museum, attests to the public's enthrallment with the 1692 hysteria.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims,Serial killers by number of victims,"A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people, in two or more separate events over a period of time, for primarily psychological reasons. There are gaps of time between the killings, which may range from a few days to months, or many years. This list shows serial killers from the 20th century to present day by number of victims. In many cases, the exact number of victims assigned to a serial killer is not known, and even if that person is convicted of a few, there can be the possibility that they killed many more. Organization and ranking of serial killings is made difficult by the complex nature of serial killers and incomplete knowledge of the full extent of many killers' crimes. To address this, multiple categories have been provided in order to more accurately describe the nature of certain serial murders. This is not a reflection of an individual's overall rank, which may or may not vary depending on personal opinion concerning the nature and circumstances of their crimes. The fourth column in the table states the number of victims definitely assigned to that particular serial killer, and thus the table is in order of that figure. The fifth column states the number of possible victims the killer could have murdered. Some of these crimes are unsolved, but were included because they are the work of a serial killer, despite nobody being caught. This list does not necessarily include war criminals or members of democidal governments, such as Adolf Hitler, Hideki Tojo, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, or Pol Pot. Only serial killers with 10 confirmed or suspected murders should be included on this list. Serial killers with the highest known victim count The most prolific modern serial killer is Harold Shipman, with 218 proven murders and possibly as many as 250 (see ""Medical professionals"", below). Excluding these ""Medical professionals and pseudo-medical professionals"", with their ability to kill simply and in plain sight, and Serial killer groups and couples (below), this list is a compilation of modern serial killers currently with the highest verifiable murder count. Serial killers with 15 to 30 victims This part of the list contains all serial killers with 15 to 30 proven victims who acted alone and were neither medical professionals nor contract killers. Serial killers with 10 to 14 proven victims This part of the list contains all serial killers with less than 15 proven victims who acted alone and were neither medical professionals nor contract killers. Serial killers with fewer than five proven victims This part of the list contains all serial killers with fewer than five proven victims who acted alone and were neither medical professionals nor contract killers.

Bundy officially confessed to 30 homicides, but had confessed to killing 35–36 women in the past, and some estimates run upwards of 100 or more. Infamous for escaping from prison twice and murdering multiple victims in one day; sometimes abducting women from the same location within hours of one another.

Accused of as many as 137 murders in five southern Mexican states, convicted of 33 murders and sentenced 50 years in prison. Tried unsuccessfully to kill himself in prison. If his claim of 100+ victims were true then Leyva would be one of the worlds worst murders, currently he is Mexicos worst documented serial killer.']['Ramadan Abdel Rehim Mansour','Egypt','1999 to 2006','32','32+','Gang leader known as al-Tourbini (""The Express Train"").

Final standings, class winners","Updates from the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2019 were important for two reasons. A live stream of the 24 Hours of Le Mans was available, but those tend to lag, and the action during the world's most prestigious sports car endurance race in Le Mans, France, was non-stop. Also, some did not get the TV channel on which the 24 Hours of Le Mans was being shown in 2019. This year's 24 Hours of Le Mans, which was broadcast in the US on the MotorTrend Network with a live stream available on the network's website, was the final race of the FIA World Endurance Championship super season. Many eyes were focused on the pair of Toyota TS050 Hybrids, which finished first (No. 8) and second (No. 7) overall as expected. The team repeated its 1-2 finish in the 24 Hours of Le Mans a year ago. MORE: 24 Hours of Lemons is a great parody of real Le Mans race The winner of the LMP2 class was the No. 36 Signatech Alpine Matmut. The LM GTE Pro class winner was the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari, and the winner of the LM GTE Am class was the No. 85 Keating Motorsports Ford GT. The 87th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans took place at the traditional Circuit de la Sarthe, an 8.5-mile road course in rural Le Mans, France. It began at 9 am ET on Saturday and ended 9 am ET on Sunday. Weather was not an issue at any moment during the race. Below are the results for all four classes from the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2019.

But two German manufacturers — Porsche (19) and Audi (13) — have by far the most wins at Le Mans among constructors. Porsche padded that number when its teams won seven consecutive races at Le Mans from 1981-87. Below is the complete list of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results,Close election results,"This is a list of close election results at national and state level. It lists results that have been decided by a margin of less than 1 vote in 1,000 (a margin of victory of less than 0.1%). To provide context, after the first table is another table showing the distribution of winning margins in different areas. Depending on the area, from 1 in 40 to 1 in 500 election contests is decided by less than 1 vote in 1,000. This list is limited to elections in which at least 1,000 votes were cast. According to a 2001 study of state and federal elections in the United States between 1898 and 1992, ""one of every 100,000 votes cast in U.S. elections, and one of every 15,000 votes cast in state elections, ""mattered"" in the sense that they were cast for a candidate that officially tied or won by one vote."" While not an election, a member of Congress once owed his seat to the drawing of lots. In 1902, after more than 7,000 votes at three conventions, the Democrats were unable to decide among three candidates for nomination to Texas's 12th congressional district. Two candidates put their names in a hat, drew one out and the loser agreed to withdraw and support the winner. Oscar W. Gillespie won the game of lots, the nomination and the following general election, serving in Congress for 8 years. There are a variety of ways in which tied elections are settled. Some are decided by drawing lots or other games of chances. Others lead to a runoff or special election. Still others are decided by some third party such as the legislature or a high-ranking elected official. In one case in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1891, it was settled with a 200-yard footrace. In that case William Simms seemed to be cruising to an easy victory for County Treasurer when he tripped and fell 3 yards from the finish line allowing Frank Hollowell to win the race instead.

Initially, a computer program was used to draw lots and Widmer was declared the winner. Following complaints and appeals, the Federal Supreme Court ruled against the Cantons decision to use a computer program for the lottery and ordered new manual lottery. This was conducted on November 25 and Marco Romano emerged as the winner. (There were 760,995 votes cast in total for 8 seats. The PPD won two seats. Romano and Widmer, both of the PPD, were tied for the PPDs second seat.)']['1994','Quebec general','Saint-Jean','0%','0','16,536','Incumbent Liberal Michel Charbonneau tied with Parti Québécois candidate Roger Paquin. Consequently, a new vote was held 42 days later, which Paquin won by 532 votes.']['1971','Virginia House of Delegates','District 19','0%','0','16,410','The initial vote count had Republican William Moss ahead of Democrat Jim Burch by 1 vote for the sixth at-large seat in what was then a six-member district. But then a three-judge circuit court ruled that one of the ballots was ""defaced"" because the names of two candidates were crossed out with the notation ""Do not desire to vote for these two"". They did this even though the person who cast this vote (which was known because it was a signed absentee ballot) testified that he intended to vote for Moss. Throwing out the ballot created a tied vote. The names of the two candidates were placed in sealed envelopes, and a blindfolded Elections Board chairman plucked one from a silver loving cup. Moss won. Two years later Moss would lose re-election by 0.03% of the vote.']['2003','Quebec general','Champlain','0%','0','11,852','PQ candidate Noëlla Champagne tied with Liberal Pierre Brouillette. Consequently, a new vote was held 36 days later, which Champagne won by 642 votes.']['2017','Virginia House of Delegates','District 94','0%','0','11,608','The initial vote count had incumbent Republican David Yancey ahead by 13 votes. After a canvas that included provisional ballots, Yanceys lead was cut to 10 votes. Following a recount, Yancey trailed Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds by one vote out of 23,215 cast. After review by a three-judge panel appointed by the Virginia Supreme Court, a disputed ballot that had been excluded as an overvote was instead counted for Yancey and the race was certified as a tie with the candidates to draw lots to determine a winner. The drawing of lots was later postponed after Simmonds asked a state court to reconsider the dispute ballot. On January 4, 2018, the names of each candidate was placed inside a film canister, both canisters were placed in a bowl and one canister was drawn at random by State Board of Elections chairman James Alcorn. David Yancey won the draw and the seat, giving Republicans control of the House 51-49. Had Simonds won instead, a 50-50 split would have prompted a power sharing arrangment between the two major parties. In 2019, the two met in a rematch in a redrawn district and Simmonds won.']['2010','Massachusetts House of Representatives','6th Worcester district','0%','0','6,587','After Peter J.

However, Tullos asked the State House to review the results, which they did, resulting in them throwing out some ballots for Eaton and seating Tullos. The vote was largely a party-line vote.']['1988','Massachusetts Senate Democratic Primary','Plymouth District','0%','0','4,543','George F.

In the initial tally, they had respectively 4195 (24.73%), 3889 (22.93%), 4191 (24.71%), and 4687 (27.63%) votes (16,962 total votes). McIntyre was initially declared to have been elected by a four-vote margin. Wick petitioned for a recount in accordance with SDCL 12-21-12. The recount was conducted in the presence of representatives for both candidates. The results were certified on December 4, 1996, and showed that Wick had been elected by one vote: 4191 (24.71%), 3891 (22.94%), 4192 (24.71%), 4689 (27.64%) (16,963 total votes). The South Dakota Supreme Court examined several ballots and invalidated one vote for Wick. The House then voted, mostly along party lines, 46–20 to seat Wick. Remarkably, two years later, McIntyre and Wick would again tie (at least on the initial count).']['1999','Nova Scotia general','Shelburne','0%','0','3,206','Progressive Conservative Cecil ODonnell tied with Liberal Clifford Huskilson (3,206–3,206).

McInnis filed a petition for a judicial recount. Provincial Court Judge John Douglas discovered that a vote for Ms. McInnis was mistakenly put in the pile for Mr. McIsaac. The result of the recount was thus that they were tied 1,173–1,173. Pursuant to section 102 of the Election Act, the toss of a coin was completed by the Returning Officer. The results of the coin toss were in favour of Alan McIsaac.']['1843','Indiana Senate','Switzerland County','0%','0','915','Daniel Kelso was initially up one vote on David Henry: 917–916. This election was extensively contested. It was alleged that two additional votes had been incorrectly given to Kelso, so that Henry had in fact won, 916–915. There was also one fraudulent vote found in favor of Henry, so the Senate Committee concluded that the correct vote was 915–915. But the Committee also found that the county provision in case of a tie (to let county officials decide the winner) was unconstitutional, and so they reported that no legal election had taken place in Switzerland County and neither Henry nor Kelso won. One book reports: Switzerland County was represented in the Senate in 1842 by Daniel Kelso; in 1843, 1844 and 1845, by David Henry. Also: ""It has been repeated time and again that the annexation of Texas was carried in the United States Senate by one vote; that Edward A. Hannegan, then the United States Senator from Indiana was elected to the Senate by one vote, and that that one vote was given Hannegan by Daniel Kelso, then senator from Switzerland County, who was elected by one majority. ""This is an error, for Kelso, when he voted for Hannegan as United States Senator, represented Switzerland County by virtue of a majority of about 150 voters of the county, over Samuel Howard at the August election of 1842. In 1843 David Henry was elected over Kelso by one majority. Kelso contested the election, and the Senate declared that neither was elected, and sent them back to the people for decision, and at the August election, 1844, Henry was elected by a small but decided majority."" (An apocryphal story continues to be told, for example by ABC News, about a ""David Kelso"" winning by one vote in an 1844 Indiana Senate election, the one vote being the vote of a dying man whom ""David Kelso"" once defended.)']['1998','Massachusetts House of Representatives Republican Primary','13th Hampden','0%','0','876','Official election results showed that Matthew Ferri won the primary, garnering three more votes than opponent Rodney Fountain, but a judge later ruled that it was a tie.

His opponent John A. Durkin then won the recount by 10 votes. After a second recount, Wyman won by just 2 votes. The Senate at first agreed to seat Wyman, who served the last 3 days of Noris Cottons term, but began to deliberate again when the new Senate took office. When the Senate deadlocked for months, Durkin agreed to Wymans proposal for a new election. The Senate declared the seat vacant and the governor appointed Cotton to hold the seat for six weeks until a special election on September 16.

The constitution of Massachusetts required a candidate to receive a majority of votes cast in order to win the office outright; otherwise, the legislature would have the authority to choose among the leading candidates. Morton exceeded this threshold by just 1 vote (50% of the 102,066 ballots cast), and had he not, the Whig controlled legislature would have been allowed to select the governor. The legislature could successfully deprive Morton of a majority if it disqualified the return from the town of Westfield. There was, moreover, an argument for doing so: the Westfield return was irregular and improper under the laws of the state because the attestation of its authenticity was not under seal. Instead, the return had been sealed first, and only afterward affixed with an attestation from the relevant local official. Despite pressure from partisans to contest this result, Everett refused. In the annals of American history there is not an equivalent example of a candidate in a major statewide election willing to forgo a victory so tantalizingly within reach based on, first, such a narrow margin and, second, such a readily available legal argument for invalidating disputed ballots.']['1984','United States House of Representatives','Indianas 8th District','0.00171%','4','116,645','Indianas Secretary of State (a Republican) initially certified Rick McIntyre as the winner by 34 votes, ignoring other recounted tallies that actually showed Frank McCloskey was in the lead.

As the recount was taking place it became apparent that there were some missing ballots, which was greater than the margin, so the election was voided and a re-run was conducted in 2014.']['1910','New York House of Representatives','36th District','0.00242%','1','20,685','Charles Bennett Smith, a Democrat, defeated the incumbent, Representative De Alva S.

A total of 55 ballot papers were excluded from the count for want of official mark, of which 18 were votes in favor of Oaten and 22 in favor of Malone. Therefore, Malone would have had a majority of 2 votes had they been included in the count. On hearing an Election Petition in the High Court on 6 October 1997 Lord Justice Brooke and Mr. Justice Gage ordered that there should be a fresh election. The petition also stated that four voters cast tendered ballots after claiming to have been impersonated, but the impersonators could not be found and the allegation was not pursued.

The Committee of Elections concluded that Allen had won by at least 1 and probably 2 votes and recommended that he be seated. However, the House voted 94–90 that Allen would not be seated and also voted 91–89 that Archer would not be seated either. The seat was thus vacated.

https://www.windowscentral.com/list-xbox-one-best-selling-games-all-time,List of best-selling Xbox One games of all time (US),"Tracking video game releases can be challenging, with several platforms and many markets to account for worldwide. With the rise of digital downloads challenging physical retailers too, market research firms like The NPD Group are among the few with trusted data-tracking on industry sales. The NPD Group's Mat Piscatella has shared data on lifetime Xbox One software sales, providing a reputable insight into the best-selling Xbox One games in the US This accounts for both physical and digital sales from major firms, aside from Bethesda Softworks, who hasn't joined NPD's Digital Panel of publishers. Furthermore, this data fails to account for sales beyond September 2018, with major releases like Red Dead Redemption 2 excluded. These are the Xbox One's best-selling games ever, as of late 2018. While The NPD Group doesn't track beyond on US sales, this still provides a rough indication of global trends. Topping the charts regularly five years since launch, Grand Theft Auto V's presence at the top spot comes as no surprise. Activision's Call of Duty first-person shooter franchise still dominates the industry too, securing four places among the best. And while exclusive in-house Microsoft titles are historically failing to gain traction, the Halo franchise still sells big on Xbox One. Let us know your thoughts on these results in the comments below.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums_in_South_Korea,Best-selling albums in South Korea,"The best-selling album in South Korea is Map of the Soul: Persona, by South Korean boy band BTS. The EP, released in April 2019, became the best-selling album in Korea of all time, with more than 3.2 million copies in less than a month. Including estimates based on illegal sales, Kim Gun-mo's 1995 studio album Wrongful Encounter is estimated to have sold at least 3.3 million copies. Of all 67 albums, which sold more than one million copies, all are by Korean artists with the exception of Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard (1992). Kim Gun-mo and Seo Taiji are the artists with the most million selling albums, having each six, followed by BTS and Exo with each five. Exo's first studio album, XOXO, became the first album released since 2001 to sell more than 1 million copies in 2013 and BTS' Love Yourself: Answer, became the first album to sell more than 2 million copies since 2000 in 2018. Between January 1999 and November 2008, the Music Industry Association of Korea (MIAK) charts were published monthly, with fifty chart positions and each album's detailed sales.
