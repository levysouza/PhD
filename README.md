# Table Retrieval Task

This repository contains my PhD implementations. We focus on matching unstructured data (e.g., news articles) and semi-structured data (e.g., web tables). Specifically, our work addresses the table retrieval task: given an article and a set of web tables, the goal is to find a table most relevant to an article.

## Articles Aspects

We consider a news article is composed by two aspects: title and body. The title briefly describes the news and it has generally 10 or 12 words. The body is a large text about the news-context. Furthermore, both aspects are presented in natural language.

## Tables Aspects
