The net results of this engagement is that Mr. Pendleton has decided to resolve things with Polly and become Jimmy's family government much to Pollyanna's delight even as Mr. Pendleton is finding the task of convincing Jimmy to see this as being for Pollyanna's sake far easier conversed than conducted!!! Unfortunately for the despondent Pollyanna, this bit of vicarious good news is not enough to conquer the software problem nullifying the utility of Pollyanna's damaged power-train; in a bid to revise the apparent dystopian epilogue, the entire town of Beldingsville converges on Harrington-ke to explain the effect of Pollyanna's glad game on their daily lives. Polly is in for quite a shock when she has chosen to isolate herself from being the first to learn the glad game and ultimately holds the key to extinguishing the software problem inhibiting the repair of her niece's damaged power-train; upon realizing this, Polly makes real progress in solving her own long-standing software problems regarding the premature death of her sister Jennie and her misguided hatred of John Whittier.",

        "In spite of it being catalyzed in no small part by Thomas and Polly's matrimonial reconciliation, it still required a half-year for Pollyanna to arrive at the point where she no longer has to remain in the sanatorium and can now spend most of her time in Beldingsville; while Jimmy and Talim devote their energies to being noisy and euphoric emissaries, Pollyanna is getting her first glimpse of how much time has gone by while she was in Boston as the train converges on Beldingsville where there is nobody at the train station to welcome her back home -- just like when she first arrived in Beldingsville a year ago. What the delighted Pollyanna finds instead is that Jimmy has organized an orchestra as the centerpiece for the whole town greeting Pollyanna upon her return to Beldingsville; after a clumsy cartwheel that is cause for concern prior to Pollyanna taking it in stride as she is helped to her feet, a joyous reunion is had by all. The festivities and Pollyanna explaining Jimmy the hill in her former hometown when the two kids release the bird they rescued obfuscate the reality of it being necessary to make weekly trips to Boston in order to keep the rehabilitation on track; as is starting to be demonstrated with Polly's mild brown-out, this requirement is a slow train to nowhere good.

        "Anguished by the data of Ruth\u2019s dystopian prologue involving her missing nephew, Pollyanna emphatically endeavors to compile an apparatus for locating Jamie Kent; while the idea to commission Mickey for gathering data as he proliferates the evening paper is enough to enable Pollyanna to shut her mind down so that she can get some sleep, corporeally conducting this enterprise is of far greater difficulty . . . especially with a rainstorm that spans across the next two days!!! Further inflaming matters is that the progress of Pollyanna\u2019s rehabilitation has placed the point where she can return to Beldingsville at much greater proximity than is really desirable; while she can take a bit of a vacation in Boston, Polly Harrington will sooner or later make the choice for Pollyanna\u2019s return to Beldingsville in a big way. Bridget explaining Pollyanna the logistical complexities that have taken their toll on Ruth when she was prosecuting this very enterprise backfires when Pollyanna reads this as an admonition for caution as she proceeds; while at the park with Mary, Pollyanna is shocked to discover that James could possibly the long-lost Jamie Kent and that she now has to compute an apparatus to bring in Ruth to make the confirmation -- once the rainstorm spanning the next five days dies down, that is. Unfortunately for Pollyanna, her successful entreaty of Ruth's cooperation as an escort to the park to have her meet James in order to confirm his identity as Jaime Kent ultimately fizzles out as a failure when James is nowhere to be found; however, Pollyanna does get an unexpected consolation prize in the form of Mickey arriving at Carew-ke with a message: James bedridden in medical distress!!!"

        "Unable to depersonalize Jimmy's agitation at the mere mention of the name Jaime or to realize that this will be of interest to Ruth and Della, Pollyanna tries to analyze for her error before resuming her home commute where Tom points out that Jimmy is more interested in how the rehabilitation has been progressing along with hearing about Pollyanna's sentiments about Boston; while Pollyanna divides her energies between chasing Chipmunk and recounting how she got lost in Boston, Polly's umbrage at Thomas's remark about Pollyanna being a miracle drug prompts a divergent concourse over the wisdom of that reference and its probable epilogue whose fruit is throw a party to celebrate Pollyanna fully recouping her groove. Meanwhile, Jimmy is in his bedroom regretting his earlier outburst when Mr. Pendleton announces Harrington-ke's intention to host a party; upon having the situation explained to him, Mr. Pendleton declares his perspective of Jimmy as a very ill-tempered but honest person that he hopes will have the courage to apologize for the right reasons.

What is not widely understood about that which has prompted Jimmy to ride his horse long and hard for a solitary session of cerebral computation is that his biological father Edward Kent saw that things would end up an absolute circus if he were to pass on without giving Jimmy any final instructions about what to do next -- hence, the envelope John Pendleton has just opened; unfortunately, Edward did not plan for his death as a contingency that would render him unable to explain Jimmy his volition that he return to Wetherby-ke in Boston. Pollyanna eventually catches up with Jimmy with the epilogue of his hasty exit: Jimmy coming above-ground as Jaime Kent does not necessarily mean that James is doomed to a lifetime of negative independent locomotion any more than Jimmy would have to accompany Ruth back to Boston; in fact, Jimmy's misguided stewardship of those legal papers is the fundamental reason that he met both Ruth and Pollyanna along with John Pendleton!!! Even with a hybrid solution in mind designed for everybody's happiness whose crucial element is that James be kept in the dark, time is ultimately of the essence when Sadie decides to explore Harrington-ke on her own with James while Ruth begins to assume malice woven into John's intentions; getting Ruth on board with this hybrid solution is actually quite tame compared to the aftermath of Timothy's guided tour ending up a bit off course . . ."

But after finding a stow-away Koala bear in the eucalyptus leaves, Zach ejects him from his jet, attached to dozens of balloons. The Kratt Brothers watch as he falls from the sky, rescue him, and name him \"Koala Balloon\". They volunteer to watch him and keep him safe until they arrive at the designated eucalyptus forest where the other Wild Kratts are waiting for them. Meanwhile, Aviva worries that the brothers might not survive the night, but Koki and Jimmy re-assure her that Chris and Martin know what they are doing. But the Koala bear makes Martin and Chris\u2019s survival in the desert even harder when he accidentally destroys their precious food and water, endangering all their lives. The two then spend their night protecting the Koala from a pack of hungry dingoes, instead of getting their much needed sleep. Eventually, Martin reveals that he packed the creature power suits anyway, just in case they needed them and use thorny devil powers with a thorny devil friend. The brothers are then forced to lose their bet with Aviva, activating their creature power suits so they could survive long enough to make it the Eucalyptus forest. After finally meeting with the rest of the team, they set the Koala free, and admit defeat, learning that even some of the greatest explorers and zoologists in his history sometimes needed help from modern day technology.

However, the invention fails, and the Kratt brothers announce that no land animal can run faster than the Cheetah - capable of running speeds up to 75 miles per hour. Aviva takes on the challenge and tries to design an invention that she hopes will outrun the Cheetah, though Chris and Martin doubt she will succeed.
