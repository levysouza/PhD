Officer Jock Buchanan appears for the first time promoted to Corporal. The murder of shopkeeper Rodriguez is overshadowed (and unsolved) by the rape and murder of a nun by two black men. They are caught and finally confess, chiefly to avoid being released uncharged into the angry mob awaiting them. Calletano faces up to an IRS tax audit. Belker arrests Eddie Gregg - his first encounter with the young male prostitute, destined to have a profound effect upon the detective."

Their existence changed when their homeworld was visited by the Guardians of the Universe who were seeking a place that would serve as a storage ground for the Green Lantern Power Batteries. This came after it became apparent that members of the Green Lantern Corps began to suffer when their Power Rings ran out of charge. Thus, the Oans sought out a means of addresisng this issue by providing easy access between a Green Lantern and their Power Rings. They learnt that the unique properties of Urak allowed for a temporal conduit between a Power Battery and Power Ring whereupon they made a pact with the native species. In exchange for rebuilding their world, the race would act as protectors and custodians of the Power Batteries that were stored in the Emerald Plains. Thus, the native inhabitants of Urak became known as the Keepers due to their new role. The unique composition of their homeworld led to the Power Batteries growing as if they were crops within the Emerald Fields. Though they held an important role in the Green Lantern Corps, their existence was not known to the Green Lanterns with even their Power Rings unable to identify the species. These conditions, however, led to a form of symbiosis as the Power Batteries provided energy that nourished Urak and fed its people. The energy of Willpower was thus infused into the singular DNA of the Keepers and provided them an amazingly potent force of will. As a result, they became beings that possessed an innate reserve of willpower which was overwhelming and not in proportion with their relatively common forms. This trait made their armor completely immune to the effects of Lantern Energy Construct that derived from Willpower in the Emotional Spectrum. Their strength of will made them capable of actually willing their own bodies to shut down and kill themselves. The lush homeworld allowed their race to prosper as shepherds in this role. Events changed for the race in 2012 when the Oans arrived on Urak and removed all the Power Batteries from the Keepers care who they referred to as undeserving parasites. This act led to Urak returning to its formerly barren existence with the Keepers struggling to simply survive, so they begin to attack another planets in order to steal their resources."

        "Green Lantern vol 1 #27",
        "The Sky Pirate first appeared in the skies over Gotham City in the summer of 1947. Nothing is known of his origins or how he had amassed the financing for the expensive equipment he used in his early crimes. His first public crime was recorded when his airship, The Flying Dutchman, anchored alongside the penthouse apartment of a Gotham aristocrat. Casting a nearly invisible net lined with grappling hooks to the side of the building, the Sky Pirate manufactured the illusion of running across the air itself. With accomplices is pirate attire, the Sky Pirate robbed the wealthy guest at the penthouse party of cash and jewelry. Meanwhile, Alan Scott and Doiby Dickles observed the odd ship and quickly investigated. Quickly intervening, Doiby engaged the Pirate's thugs while the Green Lantern pursued the Sky Pirate himself. After some initial skirmish, the Pirate lured Green Lantern onto his netting and shot him with a flintlock pistol. Expecting a ball of lead, Green Lantern was caught of guard by the knockout gas coming out of the barrel. In the meantime, the Pirate's henchman had subdued Doiby and the ship was off with its booty. Rather than kill the hero and his sidekick out right, the Sky Pirate lashed them to the hands of a Gotham clock tower just before noon. As the clock hands moved closer together, the heroes were in danger of being crushed against each other until Green Lantern used his ring to jam the mechanism driving the clock and then free himself. While the heroes resolved their plight, the Sky Pirate had made a target of renowned miser, J. B. Jasper. The miserly millionaire lived in a penthouse in downtown Gotham and made a tempting target for the airborne criminal. Playing to the miser's well known love of money, the Sky Pirate dropped a large back of money into the penthouse rose garden. When Jasper grabbed the bag, he was hooked and hauled up to The Flying Dutchman like a fish. Once on board, the courtly pirate offered the millionaire's release for the simple task of signing over his fortune. When the millionaire refused, the Pirate threatened to kill him. As he was about to force the elderly miser to his death, Green Lantern appeared off the side of the ship. Rather than be caught, the Sky Pirate pushed Jasper overboard. Rather than let the miser die, Green Lantern was forced to let the Sky Pirate escape. The Flying Dutchman immediately became engulfed in clouds and seemingly disappeared. After rescuing Jasper, however, Green Lantern noticed a cloud moving against the wind and followed it to a high peak. Hidden in the clouds, he found the Sky Pirate's hideaway, a natural cave high in the mountains of the Catskills. As Doiby engaged the thugs once more, Green Lantern pursued the Sky Pirate onto an elevator. As the two grappled, the Pirate got stronger and stronger as the elevator rose higher and higher. Hitting on the idea, the Green Lantern jammed the elevator controls into the down position, rocketing the elevator into the depths of the mountain. As they descended, the Sky Pirate weakened and panicked, become more and more withdrawn as they sank lower and lower. The Sky Pirate, as it was later learned, had Terraphobia, a fear of being grounded. His fear had driven him to a life of crime high above the lands. After his collapse, the Sky Pirate was turned over to the authorities for his subsequent arraignment (Green Lantern #27). The Sky Pirate was not long for prison and soon escaped and re-assembled his gang. After learning the outcome of a fateful expedition in the Himalayas, the villain hit on an idea to rid himself of the primary obstacle to his plans. Disguising himself as the psychiatrist Dr. Ticky, the Pirate convinced the Green Lantern that recent difficulties in maintaining altitude were psychological in nature, a result of altaphobia or fear of heights. In truth, the Sky Pirate had generated a machine that caused massive downdrafts that interrupted Green Lantern's flight in several cases. With his nemesis afraid to leave the ground, the Sky Pirate took up pursuit of explorer Arthur Paxton. Paxton and explorer Ned Barnes had discovered a rare metal, an antigravity metal, in the rocks high on Mount Everest. As Paxton explained this to Barnes daughter (Barnes had died on the expedition), the Sky Pirate made an entrance and after a brief skirmish with the Green Lantern, kidnapped the explorer. As the Sky Pirate made for Mount Everest, Doiby Dickles found a note from Paxton revealing a hideout for the Pirate's gang on the 68th floor of the Gotham Building. There the heroes discovered the Sky Pirate downdraft machine and recognizing that Green Lantern's \"altaphobia\" was merely a hoax, took off in hot pursuit of the villain. When the hero arrived, the Sky Pirate was quickly mining the rocks for the novel metal. When his excavations were interrupted by the arrival of Green Lantern, Betty and Doiby Dickles, the Pirate and his men turned their attention to the interlopers. Handicapped by his civilian tagalong, Green Lantern was overcome and the trio tied to a large piece of anti-gravity metal. As they rose out of sight, the Sky Pirate finished off his operation and set sail. Struggling against the dwindling oxygen, Green Lantern set everyone free and the trio returned to Gotham. Quickly barging into the Gotham Building, the hero found the Sky Pirate and gang counting his loot. The overconfident criminal had assumed the hero dead and returned to his comfortable suite. Caught off guard, the criminals were no match for Green Lantern and quickly rounded up. The Sky Pirate was again turned over to the authorities (Comic Cavalcade #25). At some point, either between or after the two recorded cases, the Sky Pirate was pulled into the timestream by Per Degaton to help his battle against the All-Star Squadron in 1942. Following Degaton's defeat, his accomplices were returned to their proper times and likely had no recollection of their involvement in the case (Justice League of America #193, All-Star Squadron #1-3). As of this writing, the ultimate fate of the Sky Pirate remains a mystery"

        "Knodar comes from the year 2447 A.D. on the parallel Earth-2. Everyone's needs and whims are met by machines that there is no incentive to steal, therefore no reason to create a crime or criminals. The one person who liked this idea of being a criminal was Knodar. He was inspired from old gangster movies. In his initial try at being a criminal he was caught and placed in a cell for all to see as a social anomaly. His uniform was custom, since no uniforms needed to be mass-produced, with P's stitched on the uniform to stand for prisoner. He escaped to 1947 and began a crime spree with stolen tech from his time period. He was pursued by a man named Dalmyr and took him back to his time period when Alan Scott defeated him. He would later make two more trips to the 1940s only to be sent back by Alan Scott. He showed up again during the Crisis on Infinite Earths and battled Jonni Thunder and the Star Spangled Kid. It is believed he was not the last criminal from that time period, since the Reverse Flash hails from that time period. It is also unknown how his history has altered with the new Crisis creating a new Earth. He was seen at the House, Roulette's club for criminals."

He has absorbed some of Green lantern's power due to confrontations with him. Later it is revealed that Cyrus committed suicide."

Tragedy struck when his experiment blew up in his face. Carver lived, but he was blinded. The combination of chemicals and the high frequency waves he was bombarding them with resulted in a new kind of light. The chemicals somehow affected his damaged optic nerves, permitting a more intense light to reach them, allowing the once blind man to see."
