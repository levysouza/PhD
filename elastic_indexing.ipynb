Some of the most recent Syrian refugees in Anjar arrived from Kassab, an Armenian Christian community that experienced displacement before. IBL / Rex     Taking refuge: Armenian family exiled for third time in century     Syrian-Armenians find refuge in Lebanon among fellow Armenians who fled conflicts 100 years ago    May 7, 2014  5:00AM ET   by Ben Gilbert         ANJAR, Lebanon — On March 21, 32-year-old Syrian-Armenian Savan woke up to the sound of machine gun fire and explosions. It was 5:30 a.m.  She and her family sought refuge in the first-floor hallway of their home, where they hoped the lack of windows would protect them from the bombs falling outside.  At first, she thought the fighting would last only a few minutes; perhaps it was a short exchange of fire between Syrian rebels and the Syrian army positioned near the Syria-Turkey border, which lies just a few hundred yards from her home.  But as the fighting continued for an hour and then two, she realized her worst fears had come true: Syrian rebels were attacking their mostly Armenian Christian village of Kassab (population 2,200) from what seemed to be Turkish territory. And the rebels intended to take it.  For Armenians like Savan, the fact that the attack happened to an Armenian village just beyond Turkey’s borders awakens old wounds, animosities and anger. It’s the third time her family has been driven from their home in Kassab in just over 100 years. The Ottomans deported her great-grandfather in 1909 and again in 1915, when Kassab, with the rest of Syria, was part of the Ottoman Empire.  “I feel they’re trying to do the Armenian genocide again,” she said, referring to the 1915 massacre and deportation of Armenian Christians — an event Armenians call genocide but some Turkish historians dispute. “I feel like Armenians [are] under attack.”  By 7 a.m., Savan and her family feared the rebels would cut off the highway leading out of Kassab, so they fled the village. They ran outside to their silver Volkswagen Golf, and six people piled into the compact hatchback.  “I only had enough time to grab my passport and my university degree,” Savan said.  They picked up her father, 64-year-old Harout, who had been sleeping at the restaurant he owns.  He didn’t want to leave.  “It’s like history repeating itself,” Harout said later at his sister’s house in Anjar, a Lebanese town founded by Armenian refugees who fled their villages in 1915.         Smoke rises after what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad in the Armenian Christian town of Kassab in early April.  Reuters    Several witnesses to the assault on Kassab said that the rebels attacked from Turkish territory and that the offensive couldn’t have happened without the Turkish government’s consent.  Harout said a senior member of the village received guarantees from the Turks that Kassab was secure and that no Syrian rebel attacks would be permitted from Turkish territory.  “Kassab was the quietest place in Syria,” said another resident, 44-year-old Rafi, who works as a construction contractor and farmer. “The Turkish army usually did patrols along the border every three hours. But the day before the attack, there were no patrols.”  Kassab is in a mountainous area, and the Turkish military has the high ground. Residents say a small contingent of Syrian soldiers was based there, along with Syrian police who manned the border crossings — but the better-armed and -positioned rebels overran them.  “The attacks were launched from Turkish territory. I saw them,” Rafi said. “For us, Turkey is the same Turkey as before. They are acting the same way they did 100 years ago. We’ve been exiled in 1909, 1915 and now 2014.”  The Turkish government denies allegations that it allowed the Syrian opposition to use its territory or supported the attack on Kassab. A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said that those \"circles\" making allegations that Turkey assisted in the attack were trying to create “confrontational propaganda” and to “draw an analogy between the developments in the Kesab region and the painful incidents of the past.”  The Turkish government also said that Syrian-Armenians residing in Kassab would be admitted to Turkey and protected, and that representatives of the Armenian community in Turkey had been notified.  Rafi and other Kassab natives say it is one of the last remaining Armenian-inhabited towns that date from the medieval kingdom of Cilicia, which was a semi-autonomous Armenian kingdom along the Mediterranean coast in what is now southern Turkey in the 12th to 14th centuries.  The collective memories of Cilicia, along with the events of the early 20th century, are experiences that unite the large Armenian diaspora. Survivors of the deportations and massacres during World War I built strong Armenian communities that exist to this day in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and Lebanon; some of the largest Armenian communities outside the Republic of Armenia are in the United States and Russia.        For us, Turkey is the same Turkey as before. They are acting the same way they did 100 years ago. We’ve been exiled in 1909, 1915 and now 2014.   Rafi  Resident of Kassab, Syria      In Kassab, the Armenians lived side by side with ethnic Turkmen, also Syrian citizens, who often worked for the Armenian farmers and business owners. But when the attack began, Rafi said, some of the Turkmen picked up weapons and joined the rebels in their attack on the village. He said he called his apartment, and a former employee picked up the phone.  “He told me, ‘Boss, we’re going to spend the night in your place,’ and I said, ‘You’re welcome to sleep, but please don’t destroy the place,’” he said. “He made fun of me and mocked me to his friends. And he was my employee!”  Another farmer from Kassab, Simon, said only Turkmen who joined the rebels were allowed into the village. He said a Turkmen employee who made it into Kassab helped him try to find out the condition of his home and property. (He doesn’t know the condition of his home, but his tractor, worth $18,000, is missing.)  For now, a friend is lending Simon, his wife and two sons an apartment in Anjar. His 11- and 14-year-old sons attend the Armenian Orthodox school here. He said they’ll stay “as long as the situation dictates.”  “If today we\\xa0hear that we can return to Kassab, we will return,” he said.    But Simon worries about returning to Kassab, now that the Turks broke their promise not to allow Syrian rebels to operate from their territory.  “What kind of guarantees can they offer? Even if we return, even if we clean up the town, can we trust Turks not to repeat this?” he asked.  Residents say three civilians — none of them Armenian — were killed in the attack on Kassab. Compared with the rest of Syria, the town has been spared much of the violence devastating the country.  But Harout  fears that if the Syrian army tries to take back Kassab by force, the town will be destroyed. If the rebels choose to leave, they’ll help themselves to anything they can carry.  “If the army takes it, they’ll destroy the buildings. If the rebels leave on their own, we’ll have only the buildings,” he said.  “They’re not rebels. They’re terrorists,” said Savan. “The opposition in Syria kicked us out of our houses.”  A couple visiting family in Anjar for Easter said they fled Kassab with everyone else. But they fear they have lost more than buildings or furniture: Their son is a soldier in the Syrian army. They haven’t heard from him since August 2012.  “We can always rebuild our house,” said Maral as tears welled up in her eyes and her niece picked a pink Easter egg from a bowl on the kitchen counter. “But we cannot get our son back.”            Share This:          Related News      Places   Lebanon , Middle East , Syria     Topics   Syria\\'s War , Syrian Refugees       Aleppo hotel destroyed in explosion  Syria rebels begin evacuation of Homs, the revolution\\'s ‘capital’  Syrian opposition fighters\\' withdrawal from Homs delayed  Cease-fire in Homs another defeat for Syria opposition forces                     Find Al Jazeera America on your TV      Go               Join the Al Jazeera America Mailing List    Get weekly news updates and the latest on what’s next for Al Jazeera America   Submit      Please enter a valid email address!

A ceremony is expected to be held later this month to officially recognize the community, which is just to the south of the recently designated Thai Town. \"The Armenian business and residential community in this area has indicted an overwhelming support for an official Little Armenia designation by the city of Los Angeles,\" Goldberg said. \"Organizers have canvassed local residents, merchants and property owners and have confirmed that there is broad-based community support for an official designation.\"       FEATURED Are raspberry ketones a \\'miracle\\' fat burner?

But I would have felt a lot safer if they’d caught him.”  She wouldn’t have long to wait. As the skies darkened over Boston, people left their homes to run errands, find an open restaurant, or share stories with neighbors. But within the hour, more shots were fired, and sirens rang through the streets once more. A line of emergency vehicles came screaming down Mt. Auburn Street, Watertown’s main strip. She followed the sound of the sirens until she was pushed up against yellow police tape, a few blocks from where Dave Henneberry discovered Suspect Two—a.k.a. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev —huddled inside Henneberry’s white Seahawk pleasure cruiser. There, she was joined by pensioners out walking their dogs, curious journalists and neighbors, and a group of boisterous teens whose pick-up football game had been interrupted by the manhunt’s denouement. The teen-agers jostled each other for position as annoyed news cameraman tried to wave them from the frame.  The people of Watertown felt doubly victimized. The bombings struck their city, and then, a few days later, turned their streets into a war zone . “The gunfire woke me up around 1 A.M. ,” Rivera said. She wasn’t alone. It seemed as if most of Watertown—a proud, unpretentious, and ethnically diverse community just west of Cambridge—woke Thursday night to find SWAT teams combing their backyards and A.P.C.s trundling down their narrow streets . Rivera was born nearby, but after she turned eleven her family moved to Thousand Oaks, California. After “moving around a lot,” she decided to come to Watertown to be near family. “My grandparents moved here in the nineteen twenties. They got married down the street. This is the best place I’ve ever lived.”  The state police corralled us into a cemetery, where we watched ambulances, fire trucks, and a mysterious black van pull into place at the intersection of Franklin and Mt. Auburn. “They’re waiting for him to bleed out,” said a thin man holding a police scanner high in the air. Around 7:50 P.M. , more shots were fired, sending the news crews scurrying for their cell phones. The cameraman for WCVB, Boston’s ABC affiliate, reported he had seen officers shaking hands. “No,” said another correspondent. “We cannot confirm the suspect is dead.”  Soon, more local residents were filtering into the graveyard. One couple held hands and snuggled up against a gravestone. Even before Johar, as his friends knew him, had surrendered, the crowd’s nervous chatter started turning into the sounds of a celebration. Two men stood smoking cigarettes next to the police tape speaking Armenian—Watertown is one of the largest Armenian enclaves in the U.S.—and laughing. Paul Sutherland, a robust white-haired man who witnessed the final gun battle between Tsarnaev and the police, cheerfully expostulated for any correspondent who hadn’t interviewed him yet. At 8:24, a heavily armed, camouflaged SWAT team marched past in double-time. A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and designer glasses let out a whoop. “They’re moving in, they’re moving in!” said the man holding his scanner in the air. Some cop had left his mic on, compromising radio transmissions. “You’ve got an open mic,” a voice over the scanner said. “Repeat: close all mics.”  Then, even the teens with the football got quiet. More than a hundred people were standing amid the tombstones, leaning forward and peering in the dark toward the flashing lights down the street. Another ambulance slowly pulled past us and parked with the other emergency vehicles. A cheer could be heard from the police surrounding Tsarnaev, and the man with the scanner turned toward us, his ear pressed against his headphones. “The subject is in custody,” he said. After spending the day filtering through false rumors, the journalists nearby looked apprehensive. Then the local police—the beat cops stationed at the edge of the police tape—burst into cheers, too.  It was over. The jubilation began to spread. A slow procession of emergency vehicles made their way through a gauntlet formed by the growing crowd. The ambulances, the cop cars, even the Watertown utility truck whose giant flood lights had illuminated Tsarnaev’s final hiding place were ushered through with grateful cheers. “You can set us back, but you can’t knock us down!” screamed the man in the sleeveless T-shirt.  The news crews filmed their final interviews before rushing off to Mount Auburn Hospital, where a gravely wounded Tsarnaev would spend the night. “I’m an actor now,” said one teen, pushing a friend out of a spotlight held by one producer. “We’re world news tonight,” said Diane Martinos, a mother of two who lives three blocks away. Not everyone was satisfied. Gene Fourier, fifty-three, shaved scalp and burly arms akimbo, was disappointed that Johar had been taken alive. Standing near a Fiat whose open doors were blasting the local news, Fourier said, “I’m one of those guys, you know, who’s fine with an eye for an eye.”  As the police tape fell and fluttered in the wind and the last cop cars drove off, the crowd started to amble home for the night. Stephanie Slater, an E.F.T., or “emotional freedom technique,” practitioner who has lived in the neighborhood for many years, said, simply, “Well, it’s nice to be outside.” She wants to offer free counseling to any of her neighbors adversely affected by the bombings, their aftermath, and the strange twenty-four hours when Watertown became the focus of the world.  Rivera was among the last to leave, standing with friends underneath the yellow streetlights. “I used to say nothing ever happened in Watertown,” Rivera said. “I guess I can’t say that anymore.”  Read more of our coverage of the recent events in the Boston area.

No one took responsibility for the blasts, which the police said they believed were ''criminal in nature.'' .  The first two explosions, in Alfortville on the southeast edge of Paris, occurred within minutes of each other at the monument and at the Tomtip Cafe some 100 yards away. An hour later a third explosion occurred on a street adjacent to the monument.  Nine people were hospitalized, including two who suffered facial burns in the explosion in the cafe. Eleven people were wounded at the cafe in all, most of them by flying glass.  No one was wounded in the explosion at the monument. Two people suffered minor wounds in the explosion on the street.  Ara Toranian, head of the National Armenian Movement, said the cafe was a gathering place for Alfortville's Armenians.  The monument, which was inaugurated Sunday, is of basalt and was designed by an Armenian artist, Maxime Ghasarian, and shaped like a tombstone. The explosion blew off a plaque at the base of the monument.  Interior Minister Gaston Defferre and the Secretary of State for Public Security, Joseph Franceschi, arrived at the scene by helicopter. Mr. Franceschi, who dedicated the monument Sunday, is also the Mayor of Alfortville.  At the dedication ceremony, he said the Turkish Government ''by refusing to recognize the massacre erased the reality of its horror.'' Turkish officials and newspapers protested his remarks.  The Armenians in France make up the third largest group in the world after those in the United States and in the Soviet Union. The Armenians say the Turks killed 1.5 million Armenians in 1915. Turkey disputes the number of victims and the circumstances of their deaths.  photo of rubble after explosion                                                                                  Inside NYTimes.com          Health »      Too Hot to Handle       Arts »      The Harmony of Liberty      Opinion »  Should Beach Privatization Be Allowed?

International mediators had set the bar high for the presidential talks on Friday, calling for approval of a set of basic principles that would defuse the standoff over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave that sought to break away from Azerbaijan toward the end of the Soviet period. After a meeting that lasted more than an hour, the sides released a statement saying that a “common understanding had been reached on a number of issues whose resolution will help create the conditions for approval of the basic principles.” Russia, France and the United States had applied concerted pressure on the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to approve the basic principles in Kazan. Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, has invested abundant time and political capital in the project, but the approach of the Russian election season will make that more difficult now.

The diplomat said, however, that the two sides had made less progress than mediators had hoped.  Photo        Nagorno-Karabakh seeks to break away from Azerbaijan.   Credit The New York Times    “It was clear in the talks that there is still a great deal of mistrust between the sides,” he said. “We all felt it would be possible to achieve more.” Domestic politics have proved to be a formidable obstacle to a resolution. The two-decade stalemate over Nagorno-Karabakh has stoked ferocious passions in both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and their leaders risk an angry domestic reaction if they are seen as conceding. As the Kazan meeting approached, mediators said substantive differences were small, but it was not clear whether the leaders had the political will to present a deal to their citizens.

When its predominantly Armenian population tried to break away from Azerbaijan and join Armenia near the end of the Soviet era, war broke out, leaving as many as 20,000 people dead and more than a million displaced. A cease-fire has been in place since 1994, but about 30 people have been killed annually on the boundary, and stalled negotiations have ratcheted up talk of war. Azerbaijan, in particular, has channeled its oil wealth into a military buildup; it plans to flaunt its power in a parade in the capital, Baku, on Sunday. Agreement on the basic principles would allow work to begin on a peace treaty. The principles include granting Nagorno-Karabakh an interim self-governing status, returning a buffer zone to Azerbaijani control, guaranteeing refugees the right of return, providing a safe corridor between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, creating an international peacekeeping force, and — perhaps the thorniest challenge — beginning the process of determining the enclave’s ultimate status. Svante E. Cornell, a Caucasus expert at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University , said this round of talks felt too familiar to give him much optimism. “To be disappointed, you have to have expectations,” Mr. Cornell said. “I did not. Having tracked this conflict for a decade, there have been so many moments when co-chairs and others have expressed hopes, but nothing came out of it.”   A version of this article appears in print on June 25, 2011, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Azerbaijan and Armenia Fail to End Enclave Dispute.

Most are Italian, with a smattering of American art historians and visitors of a more Levantine countenance. All exude an air of gravitas. Some disembark at the university island of San Servolo, leaving a small phalanx to continue to journey\\'s end: the Armenian monastery island of San Lazzaro.      In the year of the centenary of the mass killing of Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, the tiny island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni assumes particular significance. Formerly a leper colony, it was the gift of Doge Alviso Mocenigo to Mekhitar, an Armenian monk fleeing persecution in Constantinople. He arrived in 1717, with 20 followers, to found a monastery dedicated to the cultural and spiritual renaissance of the Armenian people. Even Napoleon, no friend to monasteries, was impressed, and in 1797 he designated San Lazzaro an Academic Institution, saving it from the axe. Today, just 12 vardapets (learned monks) and five novices remain as custodians of 200,000 books, 4,500 rare manuscripts, and a disparate collection of esoteric treasures. This Mother Church of the Mekhitarist order has become a symbol of survival, and an important centre of Armenian scholarship. We follow a trail of incense through cloisters lined with Greek, Roman and Phoenician antiquities, past the headless statue of a princess from Aquilea, and enter the barrel-vaulted church. Beyond the walls, closed to the public, lies a secret garden of great repute. Our guide, Eleanora, tries to unravel the complex theology behind this monastery. \"Mekhitar,\" she concludes, \"wanted to heal the rift between the Eastern and Western churches.\" But amid the splendid marble and mosaic, three low blind arches from the original church of 1348 remind us of the island\\'s insalubrious past. \"They were windows through which the lepers could follow Mass,\" explains Eleanora.    At the top of the ornate wrought iron \"Staircase of Mekhitar\", the work of home-grown artists hangs along one of the corridors leading to monks\\' cells; the aquiline features of Armenian dignitaries in Ottoman dress stare soulfully from the walls. The largest canvases are housed in the museum dedicated to Armenian treasures, which also has Bronze Age metalwork, gold coins from the first century BC, stamps from the short-lived First Republic of Armenia, and the sword, forged in 1366, of Leon VI of Lusignan, King of the Armenian House of Cilicia. Among the names of distinguished visitors to the monastery\\'s Libro d\\'Oro, is that of George Gordon Byron, who spent six months here in 1816, studying Armenian – \"the language to speak with God\". Lord Byron\\'s erstwhile classroom is now occupied by a perfectly preserved 2,600-year-old Egyptian mummy, called Nemenkhet, who grins, humourlessly from beneath an intricate mantle of coloured beads. Surrounded by bookcases bearing the 23 gigantic volumes of Description de L\\'Egypte – an exhaustive archaeological survey commissioned by Napoleon following his Egyptian campaign – Nemenkhet no doubt feels at home. For all its curiosities, the soul of the monastery resides in its three libraries: from the magnificent Monumental Library, whose pear-wood bookcases contain rare European tomes spanning every subject, through Byron\\'s Room, and on to the circular Manuscript Room, which houses one of the world\\'s most important collections of Armenian manuscripts, including Gospels created in 862 for Queen Melket. Most importantly, the library also holds early Armenian translations of ancient texts – such as works by Philo, Hesiod and St John Chrysostom – whose originals had been lost but were translated by the monks into Latin and thus revived. \"If the Scriptures are rightly understood,\" wrote Lord Byron back in 1817, \"it was in Armenia that Paradise was placed.\" Indeed, if you visit San Lazzaro in summer, you can sample the monks\\' rose-petal jam, which is made from the flowers in the monks\\' own private Eden.

In an operation that was months in the planning, Turkish authorities gave \\n  rebel groups the mandate they needed to attack, allowing them access through \\n  a heavily militarised Turkish border post, whose location was strategically \\n  vital to the success of the assault.  \"Turkey did us a big favour,\" said a Syrian activist with the rebel \\n  group, whose name the Telegraph knows but has been asked not to reveal. \"They \\n  allowed our guys to enter from their border post.  \"We needed to hit the regime from different sides and this was the only \\n  way from near the coast, so it was a big help.\"  Kasab, the ancestral home of the Armenian ethnic minority in Syria, which had \\n  remained relatively sheltered from the conflict in Syria.  Related Articles     New UN report describes horrific and systematic torture of Syrian victims   14 Apr 2014     Syria: Bashar al-Assad says war is turning in regime\\'s favour   14 Apr 2014     The danger is from Syria, not the Taliban   10 Apr 2014     Dutch priest murdered in his church in the besieged Syrian city of Homs   07 Apr 2014     British jihadis urge others to join war   21 Mar 2014      Residents were woken on the morning of the attack, on March 21, to screams and \\n  cries.  \"We woke to the sounds of the shelling. There was no time even to get \\n  dressed,\" remembered Bedros, 45, an Armenian resident who asked not to \\n  be identified by his real name. \"I grabbed my wife and my children. We \\n  had no time to take our things. Some people fled in their night gowns.\"  Two days later Kasab was in the hands of an alliance of Islamist groups, \\n  including the jihadist Jabhat al-Nusra, aligned with al-Qaeda. Almost all of \\n  the villages approximately 2,000 inhabitants had fled.  The night of the attack a relative of Bedros had gone to one of the main \\n  border posts with Turkey, which is only lightly armed with Syrian troops, \\n  reportedly because of an agreement signed decades before the war.  \"By the time he arrived the attack had begun. He saw the Islamist \\n  fighters standing with the Turkish army. They started launching their shells \\n  from the border\".  The Turkish foreign ministry has issued a statement stating that the claims \\n  that the government aided the opposition in the attack are \"totally \\n  unfounded and untrue\".  However, the findings of investigation by Human Rights Watch (HRW), which \\n  included interviews with local eye-witnesses, directly contradict this \\n  claim.  \"It is not feasible that these groups could have crossed into Syria from \\n  where they did without the knowledge of the Turks,\" Lama Fakih, the \\n  Syria and Lebanon researcher at HRW told the Telegraph.  \"One of the areas they used was an official border crossing that \\n  residents say has a Turkish military presence.\"  The entry through the Kasab border crossing allowed the rebels to attack the \\n  Syrian military positions near village from several sides, making it key to \\n  the rebel assault.  Rebel groups had wanted to attack Kasab for a long time, said the female \\n  activist, but Turkey had previously denied them access.  \"In the past the Turks refused to give us passage, because they said that \\n  in order to succeed in the attack we needed to be united,\" she said, \\n  referring to the battles that took place at the end of last year between the \\n  extremist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, and other rebel groups in the \\n  area.  The attack on Kasab sparked dark memories of the Ottoman massacres for its \\n  inhabitants, and a hysterical flurry across social media from pro-government \\n  sources claiming horrific massacres in the town.  Residents themselves brought up memories of massacres in 1909, and the \\n  genocide in 1915, when Kasab villagers were slaughter in their thousands by \\n  the Ottomans.  \"We always thought the Turks would attack us one day,\" said Bedros, \\n  the fellow family members who he is sharing his new lodgings in Lebanon, \\n  nodding as he spoke. \"And with the attack on Kasab it was clear that \\n  Turkey helped. The attackers came from Turkish territory.\"  Kasab was however the Syrian regime\\'s \\'Achilles heel\\' in the well defended \\n  coastal province of Latakia, where many Alawites, the same religious \\n  minority as President Assad, live.  Al-Nusra and the Islamic Front have pushed deeper into the terrain, taking \\n  control of Samra, giving them access to the coastline and engaging in fierce \\n  battles for \\'observatory 45\\', the highest mountain point in the area, and a \\n  strategically vital military position.  \"You can see why we needed to take Kasab,\" said Dr Mahmoud, \\n  diplomacy envoy for the Islamic Front. \"You can see what has happened. \\n  Now the regime is very very afraid.\"                  Turkey       News »    World News »    Middle East »    Syria »    Ruth Sherlock »           In Turkey           Riots in Turkey              Taksim Square demonstration              US ambassador to Turkey: \\'we\\'ll fight terrorism together\\'              Fire engulfs 42-storey tower in Istanbul              Turkey sends rocket launchers to Syrian border                        Advertisement                       Europe news  »         France news    German news    Italy news    Spanish news    Russian news    European Union       Advertisement          More from the web  »        Advertisement           More from the web           News Most Viewed        TODAY      PAST WEEK      PAST MONTH          Oscar Pistorius murder trial: live  Live: Oscar Pistorius takes the stand  Malaysia Airlines MH370: submarine to be deployed as oil slick spotted  City boss dodged £42,000 in train fares on commute  \\'Women who have sex before marriage should be hanged\\'      Peaches Geldof found dead at age of 25  MH370: missing Malaysia Airlines plane - April 7 and 8 as it happened  Live: Oscar Pistorius takes the stand  Peaches Geldof: post mortem into \\'unexplained and sudden\\' death  Teacher corrects student’s grammar following expletive-ridden letter      Malaysian Airlines MH370: March 19 as it happened  Malaysia Airlines MH370: March 29 as it happened  Final communication from MH370 revealed  British sniper in Afghanistan kills six Taliban with one bullet  Malaysia Airlines MH370: March 22 as it happened           Advertisement           More from the web  »                    MORE FROM TELEGRAPH.CO.UK         Barnebys           Discover hidden gems: a guide to buying jewellery    View         Visit Norway           The spectacular beauty of Norway    View         STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS           Who are the top 10 US Ryder Cup players ?

The birth of Coronation Street was celebrated last night.  Not, inexplicably, on ITV, which you would have thought the obvious place and not even on a main Beeb channel but BBC4. By Virginia Blackburn   PUBLISHED:  PUBLISHED:  00:00, Fri, Sep 17, 2010  0      The Road to Coronation Street, BBC4 Tuck it away they might but THE ROAD TO CORONATION STREET was so good it could get another airing on one of the major channels. It certainly deserves one. As this behind-the-scenes drama kicked off and the opening bars of possibly the world’s most famous theme tune rang out, the hairs stood up on the back of the neck. Back in 1960, Tony Warren (David Dawson), now something of a legend in television circles, was an erstwhile boy actor, grown up and failing to find any decent parts. EXPRESS OFFER: CLAIM £15 IN FREE BETS HERE! He decided to have a go at screenwriting instead. So he rehashed an old idea the BBC had turned down (if this is true, it must rank alongside the story of the record label chap who rejected The Beatles) about ordinary working class people in Salford to be called … Florizel Street. It wasn’t until just before transmission that the title was changed to the one we know and love today. Fortunately for Tony, he was working for something of a visionary at Granada Television, Harry Elton (Christian McKay). Although Canadian, Harry instinctively understood he had the making of a British classic on his hands so convinced Granada’s owners to give it a go. Fifty years on, it’s safe to say Harry was right. It was a joy to watch. For a start, there was all the fun of watching some of television’s most famous faces being brought back to life: Jessie Wallace did a creditable Pat Phoenix, although it took a few minutes for her accent to fall into place, while Lynda Baron was inspired as Violet Carson. It was Tony himself who had suggested Violet for the role of Ena Sharples, although he looked traumatised when she actually got it. “You don’t know her,” he explained. There was good-natured teasing at the expense of William Roache, played here by his son James as a callow youth off to start a big career as a film star and just fitting this in en route. Half-a-century on and Ken Barlow is still going strong, the only member of the original cast still in place. However, it was David Dawson and some perfectly judged dialogue that brought this drama to light. At times the script was just as sharp as Corrie in its heyday. “I want something strong enough to take Britain by storm,” said Harry. “Get yourself an umbrella,” Tony replied. Meanwhile, over on ITV1 was CORONATION STREET itself, with its focus on a soldier going off to the war in Afghanistan, demonstrating that the show is as topical as it ever was. All the same, you’re left thinking they don’t make Northern divas like they used to. The younger members of the cast would have been eaten alive by the likes of Pat Phoenix et al. Thank goodness for Liz (Beverley Callard), smouldering away at any man who still has his own teeth. You can’t help but yearn for the glory days, though. Not so HOME AND AWAY (Channel Five), also setting records for its 23 years in production to date. To listen to the cicadas on this show and see the ocean is to make a mental note to move to Australia. Now Rachel wants to drag Tony and their son Harry to Boston. It snows a lot in Boston.

Home  TV & Entertainment  TV  Today's TV               The Road To Coronation Street - BBC4, 9pm       By Jane Simon 16/09/2010       “The Manchester accent doesn’t exactly lend itself to television! Nobody in London will know what’s going on.” Back in 1960, that was the Granada boss’s reaction to Tony Warren’s script set in an ordinary northern street.  A world without Corrie now seems utterly unthinkable but throughout this excellent, bustling drama (curiously enough on the BBC), you’re constantly reminded of how Coronation Street – or Florizel Street – as it was then, might so easily have been smothered at birth.  Written by Daran Little – Corrie’s long-time archivist turned scriptwriter (who has now jumped ship and joined EastEnders) this 70-minute drama positively throbs with passion and authenticity.  David Dawson who plays Tony Warren is an unfamiliar face to me but he’s absolutely brilliant in this as he insists his cast be as authentic as the world he’s immortalised on paper.  “They’ll try,” he says of the casting director’s attempt to audition London actors, “but the audience will always sniff out the imposter.”    Advertisement\\n - article continues below »            How ironic then, that next to Warren, the most eye-catching person in this is Jessie Wallace as street siren Pat Phoenix.  You might not recognise the EastEnders star in this with a flesh-coloured complexion as opposed to her normal creosote tones, but from the moment she walks into the audition room she is already Elsie Tanner.  Likewise Lynda Baron as legendary battleaxe Ena Sharples – as played by Violet Carson and Celia Imrie as Doris Speed who played Annie Walker.  “Edna in wardrobe thinks this could run as long as The Archers,” Violet mutters as they wait for their first cue. “Ye Gods, I hope not,” replies Doris.

      "  This time Cynthia Geary, who was the daffy but wise child-bride Shelley on ''Northern Exposure,'' is the Christian blonde. Elon Gold, a stand-up comic, is her darkly handsome Jewish husband-to-be. And that's only the beginning of the formulas and stereotypes. Both Lindsay and Mark (Ms. Geary and Mr. Gold) have colorful relatives. Mark takes a sip of Lindsay's father's 75-year-old whisky and spits it out. A herd of Mark's family members barge into the calm Manhattan apartment. The couple find themselves trapped in a stalled elevator. Granted, it is on the anniversary of the first night they slept together, which is something of an update on the old forgotten-anniversary story line. There is one very promising character. Kip (Jayce Bartok, who played the rock star in ''Suburbia''), Lindsay's slightly strange brother, seems to be a variation on the character Christopher Walken played in ''Annie Hall,'' Diane Keaton's very-weirded-out brother, a guy you wouldn't want to have drive you to the airport. But by the second episode, Kip has already undergone a personality change, dressing as a matador and practicing the tango with his father in order to win a woman. He was more fun when he was crying during the duck hunt. 'Kelly Kelly' WB, Monday night at 9 If only Diane Chambers had married Sam Malone! They might have lived happily ever after, the prissy educated woman and the practically illiterate sexist playboy, battling and passionately making up, if only in the minds of ''Cheers'' fans. The creators of ''Kelly Kelly'' had to be thinking the same thing when they cast Shelley Long (a k a Diane) as a brainy English professor and threw her into the arms of a handsome firefighter (Robert Hays). And just in case there was any doubt  about the couple's problematic differences, the writers gave Mr. Hays a firefighter father who announces in the first episode that the son has nothing in common with ''these university types.'' ''Being with her,'' Dad continues, ''is going to be like watching PBS all day long.'' But that's where the similarities in the romance end. Far from being a playboy, Doug Kelly, the firefighter, is a widower with four rowdy children. He doesn't mind Kelly Novak's  pedantry or pretensions, and she doesn't object to his rough edges. Kelly is entirely too happy, in fact. On ''Cheers,'' Diane was miserable because she had to work as a barmaid despite her degrees; Kelly is the chairwoman of the English department. Diane was horrified by the gaps in Sam's knowledge; Doug hasn't revealed any so far. And come to think of it, the only signs of Kelly's academic leanings are a sentence about ''the myth of the popular hero'' and a mention of Romulus and Remus. The only time Ms. Long's characters shows a spark of her comic gift is, oddly enough, in a catfight with an obnoxious mother who is being mean to Doug's youngest. Kelly and Doug became engaged at the end of the sitcom's first episode. Between now and the wedding (when she becomes the repetitively named title character), the producers may want to call the ''Frasier'' writers and ask for tips. YOU'RE THE ONE WB, tomorrow night at 9:30 A Castle Rock Entertainment Production in association with Warner Brothers Television. Julia Newton, executive producer; John Wierick, supervising producer; Tim Kaiser, producer. WITH: Cynthia Geary (Lindsay Metcalf Weitz), Elon Gold (Mark Weitz), Leo Burmester (Bo Metcalf), Jayce Bartok (Kip Metcalf), Julie Dretzin (Robin Eichenbaum-Weitz) and Troy Winbush (Howard Perdue).\n",

      " Sure, they fall head over heels. But how will these two kids ever get along? Not that you expected something cutting-edge. But you'd think that the WB could have found something for Shelley Long and Robert Hays a little fresher than the stale \"Kelly Kelly,\" yet another TV comedy about merging opposites who somehow manage to happily coexist. * This is routine sitcomdom, with Long as the plucky, sage stepmother who manages--in the first two episodes, at least--to overcome all doubts about her ability to bring order to the Kelly household and straighten out macho Doug (Hays) about the roles of women in society. There is some occasional bright dialogue here. When Kelly doubts that she has the stuff for parenthood, Doug assures her, \"You're hurt, you're confused, you're halfway there.\" And indeed, by the end of the premiere, she has won over his surly, resistant 13-year-old \"tomboy\" daughter, Maureen (Ashley Johnson), and next week successfully resolves a conflict between ultimately pliant Doug and the 17-year-old Sean (Will Estes), who is afraid to disclose to his father that he doesn't want to be a firefighter. There are worse sitcoms on the air than this one, but a lot that are better. Meanwhile, as her academic career recedes into the background, Kelly remains hard at work on her PhD in mommiehood. * \"Kelly Kelly\" premieres at 9 tonight on WB (Channel 5). The network has rated it TV-G (suitable for all ages).\n",

      "exhaustion, however, is the \"conversational\" element of the show,\n",

      "If you're doing a national show, you have to put the effort\n",
      "in.\"  Not that Martin wants anyone to notice the effort. \"There's a\n",
      "lot of preparation required to make it sound like you've done no\n",
      "preparation,\" he says.  \"Most of the day is spent on what I call fishing. I might read\n",

      " CBN.com  Connie Smith was born to sing on August 14, 1941 in Elkhart, Indiana.  Although originally from Indiana, she spent her early years around Hinton, West Virginia, and then grew up in southern Ohio.  Following her high school graduation, she began singing locally at area frolics and on area television shows.  It was at the country music park, Frontier Ranch, near Columbus, Ohio where Connie met Grand Ole Opry Star Bill Anderson.  Anderson heard her perform and was impressed with her singing.  Six months later Anderson invited her to Nashville to be a guest on the Ernest Tubb Midnite Jamboree.  Within a year following her first visit to Music City, Connie was signed to RCA Victor Records by Chet Atkins and released the first recording of her career.  The song, Once A Day, topped the charts at number one where it stayed for an unprecedented eight weeks.  Smith’s recording of Once A Day became the first debut single in country music history by a female artist to reach number one, a record that Smith maintained for the next 25 years.  Her self-titled LP also reached number one, and served as the first of over 50 albums Smith has recorded to date.  Along with her string of hit singles and albums, she became a solid box office contender  and appeared in a series of what are now regarded as country cult classic films.  Connie appeared in Las Vegas Hillbillies, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar, Hell On Wheels, and co-starred with Marty Robbins and Doodles Weaver in The Road to Nashville.  The wake of Connie’s success carried her onto the stage of WSM’s Grand Ole Opry as a featured guest performer. Her first 22 performances resulted in 22 encores.  On August 21, 1965 Connie Smith was welcomed as a member of the Grand Ole Opry family.  The king of country music, Roy Acuff gave her the title of “The Sweetheart of the Grand Ole Opry.”  In a matter of four years Connie Smith evolved from a local housewife to one of the top artists in country music.  She was referred to by fans and critics alike as “Country Music’s Cinderella.”  However, in the midst of one of Nashville’s most notable ascents, Smith was by her own design a reluctant star.  Her main priority was her family.  Among the many changes over the past four years, a major change in Connie Smiths life occurred in the spring of 1968; she became a born again Christian.  Her life as a new child of God and some of her musical and personal decisions during this period are more often than not, the point in Smith’s story where the facts go askew.  The most common myth being that when she became a Christian, she began a ministry, and quit singing country music to be a gospel singer.  Smith states, “Becoming a Christian changed my life and gave me new life.  It added depth to me and my music as well, whether I sing a country song or a sacred song.  However, I have never thought of myself as anything but a country singer.  “By this time in my life I had my five children and there simply wasn’t enough of me to go around.  I had my family, my faith and my music.  Something had to give and I had a choice to make.  Giving up the first two wasn’t an option.  At the time, I had a house full of babies and like most young mothers I didn’t realize the situation was temporary.  I made a decision to stop recording and touring.  The majority of my performances were limited to the Grand Ole Opry.  I knew that decision would affect my career and not in a positive way.  But I’ve always been at perfect peace with that decision.  However, when my youngest of five started kindergarten I realized that it was those same babies who were now growing up and needed to be clothed, fed and put through school.  That was the deciding factor for me to start touring again.  After all of the kids were grown and the last one moved away from home, I then felt I was free to pursue my love for music, recording and songwriting which is something I’d seldom had time for.”  As the ninth decade of the twentieth century rolled on, so did Connie Smith.  After a chance encounter with fellow country star, Marty Stuart, she asked him if he’d be interested in working with her.  They co-wrote most of the 1996 self titled Warner Brothers project which Stuart co-produced.  Their working relationship became an unexpected romance and today, they have been married for more than a decade.  They continue to collaborate as artists and songwriters.  Smith and Stuart have now written more than 40 songs together.  Two of particular note are “Farmer’s Blues” and “Hearts Like Ours.”  “Farmers’ Blues” is the song that Stuart recorded with Merle Haggard.  It was included in Stuart’s duets projects entitled Compadres.  “Hearts Like Ours,” one of their rare duets is also featured on the same project.  In 2000, Smith re-assembled an archetypal country band using the template of her original Sundowners from the 1960s.  The newly minted combo is regarded as one of the last remaining authentic country bands in existence.  In an era of country music whose point of reference is more the Rolling Stones than George Jones, The Sundowners are a defiant hillbilly force that stand as a monument to classic country music.  They back Smith with a fiery wall of steel guitar-drenched twang that’s cooled by an endless stream of telecaster teardrops.  In 2002, Smith was voted in at No. 9 on CMT’s Greatest Women of Country Music.  Connie Smith’s favorite male country singer, George Jones, returns the compliment by naming her as his favorite female country singer of all time.  Dolly Parton has also credited Smith by once saying, “There’s only three real female singers; Barbara Streisand, Linda Ronstadt and Connie Smith.  The rest of us are only pretending.”  In 2003, Smith joined forces with Opry sister Sharon White Skaggs and fellow country star Barbara Fairchild.  The trio released a Gospel album titled Love Never Fails.  The project was produced by bluegrass icon Ricky Skaggs and was nominated for a Dove Award by the Gospel Music Association.  Fans of Connie Smith will soon have new projects from her to listen to.  She and Stuart have been writing and gathering songs and as Stuart puts it, “We are well on our journey back into the recording studio to begin work on one of the three projects that we have in mind to do.  The first is a traditional country collection; in wings are a gospel set and an acoustic offering.”  Connie and her band, The Sundowners, still maintain a regular concert schedule as well as  appearances on the Grand Ole Opry.  She can also be seen as a regular on Stuart’s new, weekly television series, The Marty Stuart Show , that airs on Saturday nights on the RFD network.\n",

      " On a muggy August afternoon in Baltimore, trash scuttled down Guilford Avenue, the breeze smelling like rain and asphalt. It was the last week of shooting for the fifth and final season of the HBO drama “The Wire,” and the crew was filming a scene in front of a boarded-up elementary school. Cast members had been joined by forty or so day players—mostly kids from the neighborhood. Earlier, the episode’s director, Clark Johnson, had been giving some of the kids the chance to say “Cut!,” and they’d bellowed it like drunks at a surprise party. Now, when Johnson yelled “Cut,” the kids swarmed around a video monitor to look at themselves in the last shot, pointing and laughing. “He just said it was good,” one kid complained. “Why we gotta do it again?” Johnson, who was wearing what he called his “lucky cowboy hat,” stepped away to talk to one of the professional actors. Another man—a bald white guy, unprepossessing in jeans and a T-shirt—remained by the monitor, and he answered the kids: “Hey. He’s the director . You don’t believe him? He kinda, sorta knows what he’s doin’.” The bald guy was David Simon, the show’s creator: a former Baltimore Sun reporter who figured that he’d spend his life at a newspaper, a print journalist who has forged an improbable career in television without ever leaving Baltimore. The kids listened politely to Simon and ran back to their places. Each season of “The Wire” has focussed, with sociological precision, on a different facet of Baltimore. The previous season featured a story line about the city’s anarchic schools, told partly through the character of Roland (Prez) Pryzbylewski, a young cop turned schoolteacher. Simon recalled, “On the first day, the kids were all cutting up and yelling. It was like the first day of school. You know how they kicked the shit out of Pryzbylewski emotionally on the show? The kids were doing the same to the assistant directors. One poor A.D. was, like, ‘Please! This is too fuckin’ meta.’ By the end of the year, we had a good crew of young actors, but in the beginning it was, as we say in Baltimore, like herding pigeons.” While Simon was telling this story, Jermaine Crawford, a fourteen-year-old who joined the cast last season, came over to hug him. The scene being filmed would mark the final appearance of Crawford, whose character, Dukie, comes from a family in which all the adults are addicted to drugs or alcohol.  Much of the new season, which will begin airing in January, will take place at a downsizing newspaper called the Baltimore Sun . Johnson, back at the monitor, began teasing Simon for giving so many of his old Sun colleagues small parts on the show. Among the dozens of people who have recurrent parts or cameos are Simon’s former editor, Rebecca Corbett, now an editor at the Times; the former Sun political reporter Bill Zorzi, now a writer for “The Wire”; Steve Luxenberg, the editor who first hired Simon as a reporter at the Sun; and Simon’s wife, Laura Lippman, a crime novelist who used to be a Sun reporter.  “It was like a frat house the other day, with all your newspaper pals around here,” Johnson told Simon. “What, you think somebody in Iowa’s gonna be watching and go, ‘Look, honey, it’s Bill Zorzi!’?” Warming to his riff, he added, “You ever try playing off these people who’ve never acted before? Somebody yells ‘Action,’ and they stand here like this”—he made a blank fish face.  Johnson is an actor as well as a director. He played a detective on “Homicide,” the NBC cop series based on Simon’s 1991 book by the same name, about murder in Baltimore, and in the new season of “The Wire” he plays Gus Haynes, a city editor who tries to hold the line against dwindling coverage, buyouts, and pseudo-news. In the season opener, Haynes provides a bitingly funny introduction to newsroom culture. He complains about a photographer who invariably gooses the poignancy of fire scenes by positioning a charred doll somewhere amid the debris. (“I can see that cheatin’ motherfucker now, with his fucking harem of dolls, pouring lighter fluid on each one,” Haynes fumes.) And he patiently explains to a junior reporter one of those house rules which arbiters of newspaper style cling to with fierce persnicketiness: a building can be “evacuated,” he instructs, but you cannot evacuate people. “To evacuate a person is to give that person an enema,” one of the old-timers chimes in. “At the Baltimore Sun , God still resides in the details.”  The Sun allowed its name to be used on “The Wire,” but stipulated that no current employees could appear in it; the newspaper’s offices have been re-created on the show’s hulking soundstage outside the city. This arrangement suited Simon fine—he bitterly accepted a buyout offer from the paper in 1995, feeling that it was squandering talent under new management. “The Wire,” Simon often says, is a show about how contemporary American society—and, particularly, “raw, unencumbered capitalism”—devalues human beings. He told me, “Every single moment on the planet, from here on out, human beings are worth less. We are in a post-industrial age. We don’t need as many of us as we once did. So, if the first season was about devaluing the cops who knew their beats and the corner boys slinging drugs, then the second was about devaluing the longshoremen and their labor, the third about people who wanted to make changes in the city, and the fourth was about kids who were being prepared, badly, for an economy that no longer really needs them. And the fifth? It’s about the people who are supposed to be monitoring all this and sounding the alarm—the journalists. The newsroom I worked in had four hundred and fifty people. Now it’s got three hundred. Management says, ‘We have to do more with less.’ That’s the bullshit of bean counters who care only about the bottom line. You do less with less.”\n",

      "  InterAksypn.com/Justin Gener  Vergel Meneses was feted on Wednesday by the Air 21 Express, where the former PBA Most Valuable Player serves as an assistant coach.  The ceremony happened at halftime of the game between Air 21 and Barangay Ginebra San Miguel. One of the well-wishers for Meneses was his former teammate at Ginebra, Mark Caguioa.  Meneses was Ginebra’s top gun during Caguioa’s rookie season in the PBA. With Meneses starting on the wings, Caguioa played the role of super-sub for Ginebra, earning him the nickname “The Spark.”  “Being a rookie playing with Vergel, I think he’s probably one of the guys who helped me on how to play the game,” Caguioa told InterAksyon.com in an exclusive interview.  “Him, Bal David together with Jun Limpot. They helped me and Jayjay (Helterbrand) throughout my rookie year. I was thankful naging teammate ko si Vergel.”  Meneses started his career for Presto in 1992, before the franchise was acquired by Sta. Lucia the following year.  He then moved to the RFM franchise, where he had his finest years, winning the MVP in 1995. He also played for Ginebra, Air 21, and Red Bull.  From Jawo to Fil-Ams  “Ang pinakamaalala ko sa career ko, yung pagiging competitive ko from the time na naglalaro pa sina Jawo (Robert Jaworski) hanggang sa time na inabot ko na yung mga Fil-Ams,” said Meneses.  “Nakipag-compete ako whoever is ang nakalaban ko. Nung pumasok ako marami nang established stars and gusto ko maging katulad rin nila. Pero hindi ko magagawa yun kung hindi ako makikipag-compete sa kanila.”  Before joining the PBA, Meneses starred at Jose Rizal College, taking the No. 18 jersey from his idol Philip Cezar, another Heavy Bomber alumnus. He credits his former Swift and Red Bull coach Yeng Guiao for challenging him to go up against his idols such as Samboy Lim.  “Sabi sa akin ni Coach Yeng, kung tuwing nakakalaban mo si Samboy parati kang natutulala, walang mangyayari sa career mo,” said Meneses. “Nung sinabi sa akin ni coach Yeng yun, that’s the time na na-fire up ako so everytime na kalaban ko si Samboy nakikipag-compete na ako sa kanya talaga.”  Never backs down  According to Caguioa, that competitive fire was still burning when he was teammates with Meneses.  “He is always challenging you.  Even in practice, he doesn’t back down,” said Caguioa. While Meneses was known for his aerial acrobatics during his early years, it was his basketball mind that really struck a chord with Caguioa.  “He’s a very smart player. Mataas yung IQ niya sa laro. He could do everything,” said Caguioa. “Even though hindi na siya ganoon kataas tumalon when I was playing with him, the way he passes the ball and watching him play was pretty. Para siyang Michael Jordan of the Philippines.”  For Meneses, he wants people to remember him as more than just a series of highlight reels.  “Gusto kong maalala ng mga tao hindi lang sa hangtime moves or in your face dunk or no-look pass,” said Meneses. “Gusto kong maalala ako ng mga tao na kapag crunch time, nasa akin yung bola. Manalo or matalo gusto ko nasa akin ang bola.”\n",

      "Williams' good record means he can reduce the penalty from a one-match ban to a reprimand with an early plea.  The same applies for Wilson, who was charged with striking Gold Coast defender Nathan Krakouer in Sunday's quarter-final.  Essendon will play St Kilda on Friday night and West Coast will host Collingwood on Saturday in the pre-season semis.  The panel also upheld a striking charge against Port Adelaide defender Alipate Carlile from Friday night's practice match in Alice Springs.  Carlile was booked for striking new Richmond ruckman Tom Derickx, but it was assessed as a level-one offence.  That means the biggest penalty Carlile faces is a reprimand and carryover demerit points.\n",

      "  There were two bullets.  Fired from silencer-equipped revolvers on the morning of Jan. 18, 1984, they struck Malcolm Kerr in the back of the head in the hallway outside his office. The 52-year-old president of the American University of Beirut, who had accepted his dream job 16 months earlier, crumpled to the floor.  A group calling itself the Islamic Holy War, which opposed American presence in Lebanon, claimed responsibility for the assassination, according to the New York Times.  Half a world away, just after midnight, the phone rang in Kerr’s freshman dorm room at the University of Arizona. A family friend relayed the unthinkable news. Kerr hung up, then ran into the streets of Tucson.  “I didn’t know what else to do,” he said.  Separated from family, his world crashing down, Kerr realized there was one thing he could do: Play basketball. So the next day, he practiced. The day after that, he played.  Kerr wept through a moment of silence for his father prior to tipoff against archrival Arizona State. Then he came off the bench and made his first shot. Cheers, tears … bedlam.  He became Tucson’s adopted son that day, but the game that defined his college career came four years later and 100 miles up the road in Tempe.  As Kerr warmed up on the court 30 minutes before tipoff, a small group of Arizona State students positioned themselves nearby and began their barbaric chant:  “P.L.O.!”  “P.L.O.!”  “Where’s your dad?”  Trembling, Kerr dropped the ball and staggered to the Arizona bench. Tears welled in his eyes.  “I will never, ever forget that,” said KNBR host Tom Tolbert, who played with Kerr for two years at Arizona and remains a close friend. “It was the only time I’ve seen him break down.  “I couldn’t believe the words coming out of their mouths. I went to the locker room because if I didn’t, I would have gone into the stands.”  In the blowout victory that followed, Kerr drained six 3-pointers.  In the first half.  ******  The Kerrs arrived in the Middle East in 1919, when Stanley and Elsa — Steve’s grandparents — joined relief efforts in the wake of the Armenian Genocide. They eventually moved to Beirut and joined the faculty at the American University, where Malcolm was born, raised and would meet his future wife.  Ann Zwicker arrived in Beirut in 1954. A student at Occidental College, she crossed the Atlantic in 17 days aboard a Dutch freighter, then settled in for her junior year at the American University. She had four Arab roommates, immersed herself in Ottoman history and, within a month, had met Malcolm.  They were married in Santa Monica in 1956 and began a life together than would crisscross the continents in the name of academia and adventure.  Pacific Palisades became the family’s home base after Malcolm joined UCLA’s political science department, but they returned frequently to the Middle East. (He would become the leading Western authority on Lebanon.)  Kerr was born in the hospital at the American University and spent his toddler years in Beirut before the family returned to Southern California. They packed up again in the early 1970s — Malcolm was on sabbatical — and set their sights on Tunisia and France. Kerr attended kindergarten in Provence.  “The first day I was there, I had to go to the bathroom,” he recalled. “I didn’t know how to ask in French, so I peed my pants.  “I went to the office, and they put me in checkered slacks.”  Not long after, a teacher mentioned to Ann that little “Stephon” was making great progress with his German.  German?  “We thought he was learning French,” Ann said. “So he came home and we asked him to count to 10. Sure enough, it was eins, zwei, drei .”  The family returned to Los Angeles and Kerr’s passion for sports blossomed. He became a ball boy for the UCLA basketball team and attended Dodgers games, often arriving early enough to chase batting practice home runs. One-on-one basketball in the driveway with his brother John, older by four years, usually ended with Kerr losing the game and his cool, unable to channel his hypercompetitiveness.  “Oh, I had a horrible temper,” Kerr said. “If I didn’t get a hit, or missed a shot, I’d throw these huge tantrums. But my dad would never grab me right away. He was patient. He’d wait until I calmed down to talk to me.  “My dad taught me a lot about emotions, controlling my temper and being even-keeled.”  When he wasn’t playing with his four kids, Malcolm Kerr worked. He’d come home and head into his study to read or write. Family dinners often included faculty friends from UCLA or guests from the Middle East.  During a backyard barbecue with Queen Farida of Egypt, Kerr’s older sister, Susan, acted on a dare and asked, “Would you like another meatball, your royal highness?”  The lifestyle helped foster curiosity in the Kerr children.  John has a doctorate in applied economics from Stanford and is a professor at Michigan State.  Susan earned her doctorate in education from Harvard and is a politician in England.  Andrew, the youngest, followed Steve at Arizona, worked for the National Security Council, then got his MBA at the Thunderbird School of Global Management and works in the construction business.  “I joke with Steve that he’s the dumbest one in the family,” said Bruce Fraser, a Warriors player development coach and one of Kerr’s closest friends. “He’s the least educated but the most wealthy.”  Ann, who coordinates the Fulbright scholar program at UCLA, describes it this way: “I have two Ph.D.s, one MBA and one NBA.”  The family returned to the Middle East in 1977, when Malcolm became a visiting professor at the American University in Cairo. Kerr attended junior high school and one year of high school in the ancient city, learning halting Arabic and forging friendships with kids from all over the world.  He wasn’t happy about being removed from the American “basketball track,” as Ann described it, but the experience left a lasting impression.  “You have to learn to fit in when you’re the outsider, and that gives you more understanding when someone else is the outsider,” John Kerr said. “Steve is totally comfortable with what he doesn’t know.”  ******  Kerr, 49, spoke at length about his childhood during a recent interview and credits both parents, working in concert across continents, to provide “everything I needed.” But in personality, Kerr said, he is wired like his father: Reserved but passionate (the father about Lebanon, the son about basketball), thoughtful but possessing a razor wit.  Kerr’s memories remain vivid all these years later, and he rattled them off: There is Malcolm, reading The New Yorker in the stands at Dodger Stadium. There is Malcolm, coming home from the office and making popcorn. There is Malcolm, emerging from his study to shoot baskets in the driveway.  And there is Malcolm, patiently waiting for his enraged son to settle down.  “He set such a good example,” said Kerr, who has three children. “I’ve tried to be the same way with my kids.”  The lessons imparted at home and the experiences gained overseas — “They all got thrown into bathwater and survived,” Ann said — combined to shape Kerr’s worldview, foster a sense of empathy and sharpen his interpersonal skills.  Those same skills would help carry him through a 15-year NBA career — a second-round draft pick, he won five NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs — and ease his transition to coaching.  “I developed a lot of compassion living in Egypt, seeing the poverty,” he said. “The discussions around the dinner table about world politics and understanding how fortunate we were — all that helped me gain perspective on life.  “That helped with teammates when I was a player and now as a coach.”  Early in his acceptance speech for being named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player, guard Stephen Curry thanked Kerr for not letting the Warriors get complacent and noted, “You’re very humble in the way you’ve approached this season.”  Kerr’s first move spoke volumes: He assembled a first-class coaching staff, with lieutenants (Alvin Gentry and Ron Adams) who were better versed than him in critical aspects of the game.  He never felt threatened by the players’ fondness for former coach Mark Jackson and allowed them to keep several traditions from the Jackson era.  He gained Curry’s trust, inspired disillusioned center Andrew Bogut, managed David Lee’s reduced role and convinced veteran Andre Iguodala, a longtime NBA starter, to come off the bench.  “You’re a huge reason why we’re here today,” Curry said as he turned to Kerr during the MVP acceptance speech. “Thanks very much for being you.”  xxxxxxxxxxxx  * Follow me on Twitter: @WilnerHotline  * My e-book, “Andrew Luck: Inside the Making of a No. 1 Pick,” is available for $2.99 on Amazon for Kindles and for other devices (PCs, iPads and iPhones) with the free Kindle app.  * Download the Bay Area News Group’s new iPad app for more college sports and other news, or check out college sports coverage on MercuryNews.com.\n",

      "THIS week we look at the formative years of the Football League and it was Preston who were dominating the scene.  In the white hot atmosphere of Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, Preston North End came within a whisker of returning to the top flight division of the English football league, a league that they had helped to create back in 1888.  William McGregor, a far-seeing and inspirational director of Aston Villa called a meeting at the Royal Hotel in Manchester on April 17, 1888 to discuss the possibility of forming a league from the interested clubs.  Over their ham and cheese sandwiches, black pudding and pickles all washed down by brown ale, they drew up a plan to play home and away fixtures thus, the Football League was on its way.  Absolutely no one who attended that meeting could possibly have envisaged that they were embarking onto a road that would become the wonderful game that we have today. Certainly no one could have thought for just one moment that it would last so long and that over that long time span to today's game that there would be so few changed to the original rules.  Twelve clubs emerged to start the league, Preston, Accrington, Blackburn Rovers , Everton, Bolton, Burnley, Derby County, Notts County, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa.  Note. Not a mention of Manchester United or Liverpool or Arsenal. They would come later.  The first season of the league was a walk-over for Preston as they won the league at a canter. They played 22 matches, won eighteen of them, drew the other four finishing with forty points which was eleven points clear of Aston Villa in second place.  Only once in the season did Preston fail to score and that was against Accrington.  For good measure, Preston went on to complete the double by winning the FA Cup without conceding a goal in the competition.  Preston's route to the final went like this: First round -- Bootle 0, Preston 3; Second round -- Grimsby Town 0, Preston 2; Third round -- Preston 2, Birmingham St George's 0; Semi-final -- Preston 1, West Bromwich 0; Final -- Preston 3, Wolverhampton 0.  Not surprisingly, the League Championship trophy and FA Cup successes quite properly earned Preston the title of \"The Old Invincibles\" something that is still referred to this present day.  Next week, we shall look at the events running up to the first World War in 1914 when so much happened to indicate that the world of football had put so much in the daily lives of men, women and children throughout the country.  Football was dominating the domestic entertainment arena, games were being played in front of large audiences and the names of footballers and their performances were the talk of pubs, homes, school playgrounds across the nation.\n",

      "“We are Family”  In addition to Kotleba’s “Our Slovakia,” two other new parties crossed the threshold: #Siet (“Network,” yes, with the hashtag) with 5.6 percent and “We Are Family” with 6.6 percent of the vote.  “We Are Family” used many of the typical appeals made by new parties. Its leader, Boris Kollar, mixed anti-politics appeal (including the slogan “I’m not a politician, I do things differently”) with a stress on his wealth (“I’m wealthy so unlike other politicians I don’t need to steal from the state”).  Kollar is a prominent personality and businessman whose celebrity owes something to his colorful private life. He has nine children with eight different women. At first glance that doesn’t appear to fit his party’s name. But in Slovak the phrase “Sme rodina” conjures up a sense that family is what makes you strong, and also a feeling that everyone is in this together.  “#Siet” (hashtag included)  #Siet was widely expected to perform much better. Its leader, Radoslav Prochazka, seemed the most likely person to replace Fico as Slovak prime minister. During the last week of the campaign, however, the party lost momentum and energy. #Siet had been formed nearly two years in advance of the elections, and it no longer felt so new and full of fresh ideas.  Furthermore, #Siet’s success in opinion polls had turned the spotlight on the party’s program — and more to the point, to Prochazka’s personality, which journalists tended to portray negatively.  In contrast, Kollar’s party was founded in the fall and only at the last minute appeared likely to cross the 5 percent threshold. As a laggard, We Are Family didn’t get journalists’ attention. Timing is everything in comedy and, it seems, in politics.  Christian Democrats  Both #Siet and We Are Family took votes from one of the perennials of Slovak parliamentary politics, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), which for the first time got less than 5 percent of the vote and dropped out of parliament.  KDH paid the price for not passing the baton to a new generation. Not only had Prochazka been a member of KDH, but the former crown prince of the party, Daniel Lipsic, had left KDH after the 2012 elections. Lipsic joined forces with Igor Matovic’s Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OLaNO). Together they garnered 11 percent in the elections.  If either Lipsic or Prochazka had stayed in KDH and become leader, the party would probably have stood a better chance of crossing the electoral threshold.  Freedom and Solidarity  Perhaps the most surprising result of election night was the 12.1 percent won by Freedom and Solidarity (SaS). A new entrant in 2010, the party has suffered several defections. Its support had been fluctuating around 5 percent throughout most of the parliament. The endurance and success of the party owes much to party leader Richard Sulik’s prominent Euroscepticism, as well as the party’s pro-market and social liberal views and its effective use of social media.  More detailed research is required, but apparently the fear that SaS would get less than five percent of the vote helped it mobilize support. In fact, both SaS and OLaNO, which also appeared likely to drop below the 5 percent threshold, performed better than expected, while #Siet and Most-HID, which had seemed more comfortably over the threshold, performed worse than expected.  Perhaps anti-Fico voters wanted to use their votes strategically to get as many opposition parties into parliament as possible, diminishing the chances of a Fico government.  The more Slovakia’s parliament changes, the more it stays the same  Despite all the new parties in parliament, Slovakia’s 2016 election does not represent such a great change. The relative balance of support among the various blocs resembles that of 2006.  Slovakia’s experience here is in line with other countries in the region where fluid party politics can mask an underlying stability.\n",

The same applies for Wilson, who was charged with striking Gold Coast defender Nathan Krakouer in Sunday s quarter-final.  Essendon will play St Kilda on Friday night and West Coast will host Collingwood on Saturday in the pre-season semis.  The panel also upheld a striking charge against Port Adelaide defender Alipate Carlile from Friday night s practice match in Alice Springs.  Carlile was booked for striking new Richmond ruckman Tom Derickx, but it was assessed as a level-one offence.  That means the biggest penalty Carlile faces is a reprimand and carryover demerit points\"\n",

Harout said a senior member of the village received guarantees from the Turks that Kassab was secure and that no Syrian rebel attacks would be permitted from Turkish territory.  Kassab was the quietest place in Syria,” said another resident, 44-year-old Rafi, who works as a construction contractor and farmer. The Turkish army usually did patrols along the border every three hours. But the day before the attack, there were no patrols.  Kassab is in a mountainous area, and the Turkish military has the high ground. Residents say a small contingent of Syrian soldiers was based there, along with Syrian police who manned the border crossings — but the better-armed and -positioned rebels overran them.

Rafi and other Kassab natives say it is one of the last remaining Armenian-inhabited towns that date from the medieval kingdom of Cilicia, which was a semi-autonomous Armenian kingdom along the Mediterranean coast in what is now southern Turkey in the 12th to 14th centuries.  The collective memories of Cilicia, along with the events of the early 20th century, are experiences that unite the large Armenian diaspora.
